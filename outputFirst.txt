Decoded Preds:
You are more familiar with the high mountain peaks in the speakers, but today they are on the stage.
Well, I'd like to say that every successful person must have been very, very hard-working, like a built-up stage, with a lot of successful people.
I am a little frightened today that I cannot say that I have succeeded, but I must be a hardworking man.
A lot of people say that the power of dreams is not the Eastern Guard's slogan?
Yes.
The focus is on the last four words: to do nothing.
First, there's a little interaction.
I'd like to ask you to think about what you were playing when you were twelve or three years old.
Decoded Labels:
Most of you are familiar with the voice of me in the broadcast, and now I'm here, in the flesh.
I'd like to say that every man of success is bound to be very diligent and hardworking, just like all the successful people that have come here at Zaojiu Talk.
I feel a bit uneasy about claiming to be successful, but I do believe I'm a hardworking man.
People say the slogan of the Dragon Television is "the power of dream".
Indeed.
But the essence comes after, which is to "be meticulous".
First, let us interact a bit.
Now if you think about it, what you used to play with when you were around the age of 12 or 13?
Decoded Preds:
Think about it. Can you shout it out loud?
What are you playing at?
Boys should play some racing or something, or sports, basketball, football.
I'm not like you. I'm playing with this thing.
Someone's looking. Hey, candles, whips, hey!
The candle was a candle, the next one was not a whip, it was a laser pen, and then it was a flashlight and a fish line.
What am I doing with these things?
When I was 12 years old, I set up a stage with these things, but it was just in our hall.
Decoded Labels:
You may tell me loudly.
What did you like to do?
I assume that boys would play with toy racing cars or do sports like basketball or football.
I was perhaps different, here are the things I used to play with.
These may seem like candles or whips or something else to you.
You are right about the candles, the thing beside is not a whip but a laser pen, then there is a flashlight and some fish wires.
What did I do with all these things?
I built a stage with them when I was 12, it is now kept in my house.
Decoded Preds:
Look at the top left corner, this is the sketch of a stage I drew at the time.
Very luxurious, but as simple as it looks, it's really luxurious, and it's luxurious in my mind.
Because it's a four-faced table, it's a six-block show area, and it's an elevator.
And its manufacturing process, it's very simple.
Some wood, some glue, and then you'll see a LeBone bottle.
A lot of people don't know why this stuff is here.
Because of chasing light.
I put a little light in the bottle, and it's a little beam.
Decoded Labels:
You could look at the left corner of the screen, this is a sketch I drew of the stage.
It looks shabby but in my eyes it is luxurious.
It's a four-sided stage, with six performance areas, and elevating platforms.
Its fabrication was very simple.
Some pieces of wood, some glue, and an empty Robust milk bottle.
You may find it confusing to see a milk bottle here.
To have the followspot.
I lit a candle and put it in the bottle, and the light came out as a beam of light.
Decoded Preds:
So it was entirely in my imagination to build a stage.
This is a big piece of engineering that I designed for a little kid.
And now, more than a decade later, I realized my dream of finally becoming a real stage director.
All these years, I've been the director-in-chief of the party part of the Orient Monument Music Festival.
So on the left, we're looking at this year's design, including our scenario.
And on the right, at the Mercedes Benz Cultural Center, where there was nothing, the stage was built one by one, from the lamp frame, the base table, to the end, we had a very luxurious and beautiful stage.
For the past 25 years, it has been a very important example of the entire Chinese-language music platform, and the most authoritative and luxurious award ceremony in every year.
Well, I didn't say there should be applause here.
Decoded Labels:
So a stage was created out of my pure imagination.
A big project from a little boy.
Now it's been over a decade, and I become a real stage director, making my childhood dream come true.
I've been acting as the chief director of the afterparty of the ERC Chinese Top Ten Awards these past few years.
On the left of the screen is the design for this year��s party, with camera placement included.
On the right is the process of building bit by bit in the Mercedes Benz Center, a luxurious and gorgeous stage, starting from the light stands and performance platforms to a final stage.
Over the past 25 years, the ERC Chinese Top Ten Awards has become a standard record chart of Chinese music and the most authoritative and grand ceremony in Mainland China.
I should end this sentence by asking for applause.
Decoded Preds:
Okay, thank you. Thank you.
Actually, what I'm trying to say is that some people say, "Oh, that's pretty impressive, uh, the director of this party."
Actually, I'd like to say that, like my title, this "do nothing."
I first traced my origins to the Eastern Clouds list 21 years ago, when the fifth Eastern Clouds list was made.
I've been involved in this Eastern Watch, and it's been a year.
So every March is a time I'm particularly impressed with, and I send a circle of friends saying, "Oh, 19 years, 20 years, 21 years this year."
But why would I feel that way?
It's because when I first started doing this, I was really just a kid with a lot of stuff, and the label was a kid.
Decoded Labels:
Thank you!
Some people may think it's awesome to be the chief director of the party.
Well, I'd say, just like the slogan I mentioned before, I'm "meticulous".
My relationship with the ERC Chinese Top Ten Awards dates back to 21 years ago when the fifth ceremony was held.
I started to work for the awards since then and I haven't missed out on any one of them.
So I feel very emotional every March, and I would post things like, "This is the 19th year; the 20th year; the 21st year..."
Why would I be so emotional?
Because I was just a handy man when I started, a nobody.
Decoded Preds:
And I started to label the key word for this line called "run" out of the data.
Let me give you an example.
Do you know her at the upper left corner? Do you know her?
Singer.
What about the one on the left?
What about the one on the right? I'm sorry.
"Drink the poison you have hidden."
The English are the most popular female singers on the 6th Orient List.
Decoded Labels:
Now here I put the key word, "run the result".
Let me give you an example.
Do you recognize the lady on the left corner?
She is a singer.
What about the one on the left?
Sorry, on the right?
"Drank the poison you hid".
She��s Na Ying, the top popular female singer in the sixth ceremony.
Decoded Preds:
What about the one on the left? What about the one on the right? I'm sorry.
Sun-nan! Yes!
He's also a regular award-winning guest on the Orient List.
And do you know how the most popular singers, both male and female, were chosen at that time?
It's in a place like the U.S. Shanghai Stadium, the Shanghai Changning gymnastics centre.
Thousands of viewers arrived with a ballot paper, which was ticked out with pencils.
In a small room, kids like us count it as fast as they can, who's the most popular female singer and who's the most popular male singer.
So what we did at that time was the "number" data, which was not calculated by the computer, but actually by us.
Decoded Labels:
Further to the right, do you know him?
Yes, he's Sun Nan.
A regular award winner of our ceremonies.
But do you know how the most popular male and female singer were picked out back then?
Well, it all happened in venues like Shanghai Indoor Stadium or Shanghai International Gymnastic Center.
A few thousand audiences would receive a voting registration form, and they would pick out their favorite female or male singer with a pencil.
Then our staff like these boys would count the votes in a room as fast as they could to get the final results of most popular male or female singer.
So literally we were counting all the votes and collecting data by hand, not by computers.
Decoded Preds:
One vote, two votes, three votes, four votes... one vote, two votes, three votes, four votes...
Then why did you run out of it?
When the results were completed, the director group selected the best salesman, not me, from all the young friends, and ran to the stage and handed the little note to the moderator.
The moderator said that this is the most popular female singer in our fresh-out 6th Orient Clouds list. Congratulations on the English!
So no one at that time would care to say how many kids are behind this job.
But in retrospect, it is felt that, well, the Orient Winds list has been from the smallest and smallest jobs until later, including entertaining artists.
This includes being a live director on the stage, and later I can build the whole party with me and my team, and I think it's a really amazing process.
And then there's a little bit of interaction, and we like it very much as radio hosts, and you forgive me.
Decoded Labels:
We count every one vote for Na Ying and those for many other singers.
Why did I say "run"?
Because once we had the result, the directing team would pick a good-looking guy, who was not me, to run on the stage and pass the result to the host.
And the host would announce, "The winner of the most popular female singer for the sixth ERC Chinese Top Ten Awards is Na Ying, congratulations!"
Nobody cared about how many people have worked for the results behind the stage.
Now that I recall, I have worked on the most trivial matters of the event, then I took care of the celebrities,
Later I was a stage director and finally I'm not building a grand ceremony with my colleagues, what an amazing journey!
Now I'd like to have one more interaction with you, and I'm sorry it's just the habit of a host.
Decoded Preds:
Some people may be shyer and shy. It's okay. I won't name anyone who stands up.
Please note that this is an award-free question time, and please note the little words on it.
This is an awardless question time of exposed age.
And I advise you not to respond lightly.
Please raise your hands if you know what this thing is!
Your friend who raised his hand, please shout out what this is?
Okay.
You're all consciously exposed to your age.
Decoded Labels:
For those who are shy, I understand and that's OK, and I won't ask you to stand up.
Please note that this is a quiz without prizes, and you can see there are captions on the picture.
This is a quiz that tells your age.
So think twice before answering it.
Raise your hand if you know what it is.
Those with their hands up, please tell me what it is.
Great.
Those who know it, you are old.
Decoded Preds:
Walkman, walkman, walkman, walkman, walkman, walkman, walkman, walkman, walkman, walkman, walkman, walkman, walkman, walkman!
Well, I did see some young friends asking, "What is it, what is it?"
It's actually a taped thing.
It's basically no one's going to use it to play the tape anymore.
And as you can see, we have a very good director, who found this walkman with a conversation in English, and I'm basically a popular album of some popular singer.
Well, speaking of this little walkman, it's one very enlightening thing that I do for DJ, and it's an important thing.
I was inspired by the fact that I was exposed to some of the popular music at the port, which was in the form of a tape.
And every time I finish my homework, I'll hide in the corner of our balcony, put a taller chair, put a little stool, sit over there and pretend with this walkman to be a DJ, and then play a song and make a show.
Decoded Labels:
This is a Walkman!
Well, I can see some young people wondering what that is.
It is a cassette player.
But now nobody uses it anymore.
One of our fellow directors is impressive, his walkman plays English dialogues, while mine was all about pop music albums.
Speaking of the Walkman, it is important for me as it inspired me to be a DJ.
I came to know some pop music from Hong Kong and Taiwan, mainly by cassettes.
Every time when I finished my homework, I would hide myself in the corner of the balcony, with a high-heel chair and a low stool, pretending to be a DJ playing music on a program.
Decoded Preds:
For some time, my parents didn't know why I was always running around the corner of the balcony.
When I was shy, I was kind of shy, kind of introverted, and I got a curtain to pull it up and run the show inside.
Then, of course, it's not enough to own it. There must be a target to match.
My idols, Chullene, Limhai, Liao Lu, were all famous names in that year.
And I've got a target, my favorite host, Charlene.
I've been writing her letters, and every time I hear the show, I start writing.
I'm listening to this show where I feel good and where I feel bad.
And then I got a phone call, and I called and I said, "Oh, my God, I listened to your show today, and you played that song so well today, and how did you say it so well?
Decoded Labels:
For a while my parents didn't know what I was doing on the balcony.
As I was very shy and introvert and I acted as a host hiding behind the curtain of the balcony.
It was far from satisfying to host on my own, so I needed an object as a guest.
My idols were celebrities like Qiu Lin, Lin Hai, Sui Lei and Xiao Lu, who were all very famous.
I chose one of them to be my goal, Qiu Lin, my favorite host.
I kept writing to her upon the end of her broadcast program.
I would tell her which part of the program was good and which was not.
Then the telephone came along, so I would call her and tell her things like, "Qiu Lin, I listened to your program today, you played a great song today and you had some great comments."
Decoded Preds:
Or sometimes it feels like she's saying that she might say something that's not very good, that you're not in very good shape today, so I heard you ate eight screws.
And then I think about it, and when the host hears this kind of phone call, he usually turns dozens of blindfolds.
And I kept on doing things like this, and she finally touched her heart, and she told me, "Let's try it on the show."
Because at that time, there was a one-and-a-half-hour video programme, which was conducted by listeners as guests on a Saturday basis.
At that time, I had a real chance to enter the most sacred building in my mind.
The broadcast building, which was awarded the Rubin Prize for a high-quality project, entered for more than 20 years.
In 1997, I remember going to the radio station, and I specifically asked my friends to tape the show for me, and then I listened to it and found it hard to hear it.
It's a real sound, because stress floats and then it's in the middle of a change, and it's completely impossible to listen to it.
Decoded Labels:
Sometimes, I would call and say, "I found some of your comments weird today. You are not in a good state, I heard you made 8 mistakes."
Later when I recall this, I think the hosts would definitely roll their eyes when hearing people talking like that.
Finally, Qiu Lin was touched by my consistent calling and writing, and one day she invited me to do a program.
It was a thirty-minute recorded broadcast program co-hosted by an audience guest every Saturday.
And I had the opportunity to step into the broadcast tower, the glorious building in my heart.
The tower has won the Luban Prize and I worked here for over 20 years since.
I can still recall when I first went to the program in 1997, I asked my friend to record the whole program for me, and I listened to the recording and realized that my performance was so terrible.
Because I was too nervous to speak, and I was experience voice change at that time, so you would find the recording pretty awful,
Decoded Preds:
And I don't want to take it out again for another show.
But this is my first time.
Since 1997, I have been on the radio to do the most basic work, editing, production and, later, planning activities.
It's starting with the kids.
And then, actually, kids, it's a little bit of a technical job. What do they do when there's more? Is that it?
Hey, some little friend, you get me a delivery.
Well, some little friend, you can help me get one of those take-outs.
Essentially, 50 per cent of the children's functions are for the last 100 metres of takeout and delivery.
Decoded Labels:
And I would never want to listen to it again.
However, it was the beginning of my career.
In 1997, I started to work at the radio station and my work was basic, including editing and producing, and some plannings.
I started as a handy man.
Actually, these works were quite complicated for a boy of my age back then, however, most of the time we were doing some other works.
Like, fetch an express delivery.
Or fetch a take-out delivery.
Basically, 50% of our work is about fetching delivery or take-out within 100 meters' distance.
Decoded Preds:
Then you see a bunch of letters in it, and now you feel like you're still writing.
But it's true that, over a decade ago, the radio received so many letters every day for the red hosts.
If he was in a club like a thousand people, he would now be called a club, formerly a disco, where he could hold meetings with his listeners.
There could be a thousand listeners on the scene, no star, that's the host.
The brightest star on the stage.
So it was the golden age of the radio!
For a very long time, from 97 to 2005, I had hoped that I would be able to have a programme of my own.
But until 2006, nine years after I first stepped into the broadcast building, I really belonged to a show that belonged to me, called "Nine Point Madness."
Decoded Labels:
You could see that there are a pile of letters, and you may think nobody would write letters these days.
However, when we go back to about a decade ago, popular hosts would receive tons of letters from their fans.
And they would have meet-and-great parties in a disco, the nightclubs back then, that could hold a thousand people to interact with their fans and audience.
One thousand fans would come just for the host, not any other celebrities.
And the host is the only shining star on the stage.
So we could say that it was the golden age of radio broadcast.
From 1997 to 2005, I have always been wishing to have a program of my own.
Nine years after I came to the tower, in 2006, I realized my dream by having my own program, Jiu Dian Ren Lai Feng (Crazy at Nine).
Decoded Preds:
We've been looking back for 12 years since then, so often we go out and, uh, run out of customers, or meet this guy who says I've heard of your show.
I hear voices from time to time. I grew up listening to your show.
I would have rejected it, because I'm not very old, and I'm also a middle-aged man, but it's always weird.
And then someone told me, "Well, you've been thinking about it for 12 years.
And it's because the radio starts doing things from all the foundational work, small work, and then I end up with the opportunity to pass on my thoughts, thoughts and songs to my listeners in front of this scene, which is the microphone.
And then we play a little game, and you look at the interaction again.
I'm sure the host really is.
The radio host just likes to interact, so let's interact.
Decoded Labels:
Now it's been 12 years, and I would always hear people, including some of my clients saying that they have listened to my program.
Some would even claim themselves as my fans and having listened to my program since they were kids.
I would sometimes find these words annoying, since I'm after all not that old, although I'm a middle-aged man now. These sound weird.
Later on someone told me that, "Just think, your show has been on for 12 years. If your audiences back then were just in middle school, they are now already adults in their twenties, some may already become parents."
I worked from the backstage to the front stage, from handy man doing trivial work to a host with a microphone sharing my thoughts, ideas, favorite songs with my audience.
Now I'd like to play a game with you, another interaction.
My bad.
Thank you for your cooperation and understanding, it's just in the blood of a host.
Decoded Preds:
Now we'll pair two pairs, you can pair two pairs with the man on your right.
Two pairs, take your initiative.
That's the way you sit, then match the man on the right, okay?
If you don't look him in the eye, you'll come into his ear, say something to him, and say, how are you today?
Okay?
Come on, let's do it.
That's it, that's it, that's it. Don't look at his eyes, don't make eye contact, just say, how are you today?
Come on, three, two, one.
Decoded Labels:
Now I'd like you to make pairs with your neighbors.
Be active.
You can pair with your neighbor in the left or right.
I'd like you to turn to his/her ear and say one sentence only, without looking at him/her, "Did you have a good day today?"
Alright, that's it.
Okay, you may start.
Please note your tone and emotion when saying the sentence, and don't look at their eyes, no eye contact, just say the sentence.
Three, two, one.
Decoded Preds:
Everybody's a little shy, but somebody's done it.
Now we're going in a different way.
Or are you two pairs, but please note that before you say anything, raise your mouth and then say to him, "How are you doing today?"
Come on, three, two, one.
Try it.
Does it feel different?
This is my experience as facilitator for all these years, because we don't see our audience. We touch him with what we do. We rely on our sincerity and the joy we convey.
That's how we do it. I keep smiling to talk to you and smiling to make you feel happy when you listen to my show.
Decoded Labels:
I see some of you are very shy, but some actually did as I asked.
Now let's do it another way.
You still pair in two, but before you say the sentence, please smile and ask," How was your day today?"
Now, three, two, one.
Give it a try.
Do you feel the difference?
This comes from my years of experience as a host, as I can't see the faces of my audience, I have to be sincere to touch them and make them happy as well.
Just in the same way we just did, by talking in smile and making you feel it's happy to listen to my program.
Decoded Preds:
So there was actually a very, very large crowd of fans at the time.
There's even a fan who helped me set up a group called High Mountain, a post-DJ, uh, Global Backup.
So it was like, wow, really public, so happy.
And then on all the TV shows, it's like, oh, my dream of life has reached its peak and it's come true.
But then, in 2011, it suddenly became clear that our industry had changed.
What kind of change did we make at the time of Momentum 101?
It is we who decide what song you play every day, what type of song you play, how many songs we play, and what kind of song we turn into a single frequency to organize the song.
It's a subversive change.
Decoded Labels:
I had many fans, some of them even formed a fan club for me.
It was called "Gao Shanfeng" or "Global fan club for DJ Gao Shanfeng", I can't remember if there was a "global" in it, anyway that made me sound influential.
I felt like a real public figure, and I was very happy.
All kinds of TV shows and programs invited me, and I felt that my life dream was coming true.
But later on, something changed in this industry in 2011.
What was the change in the program "FM 101"?
Before that, it was the the host who decided what kind of songs and how many songs to play in the program, but since that year, it was determined by the FM.
That was a transformative change.
Decoded Preds:
Our professional term is "format radio," which is "format music radio."
Which means you might feel like, uh, listening to High Mountain at noon, he's been playing some very sunny and happy songs.
By the next hour, another host he likes to rock roll this whole hour.
And then the next hour, he likes the ancient wind, and then all the time, the ancient music.
Did you say that the character of the host was highlighted?
Yes.
Can you remember his music style?
Yes.
Decoded Labels:
We call it format radio, a new type of radio program.
So when you listen to my program at noon, you may find that all songs are happy and light.
And one hour later, it would be rock and roll because the host likes it.
And one more hour later, the host would play ancient and classic music.
Would the personality of the host stand out this way?
Yes.
Will the audience remember his music preference?
Yes.
Decoded Preds:
But this station, it's completely fragmented.
So what are we doing after formatting the music station?
It is up to the audience to decide what kind of song to play.
So even if I'm a DJ, I'm the director of this station, and I can't decide what song it's about.
It's all for the audience, and it's for the audience to decide.
That is why, over the years, the music stations, especially in Shanghai, have done very well in the entire Shanghai broadcasting market.
And thank you at the same time, what do we say is good and good?
There is a general awareness of traffic in Shanghai, and traffic is blocked.
Decoded Labels:
But, the whole program is broken, without its own style.
So with the format radio, how things work?
We let the audience decide what to play.
Therefore, even if I am the DJ controlling the program, I can't decide what songs to play.
The audience would have the final say.
That's why we witnessed encouraging results in music radio programs especially in Shanghai in recent years.
Also, we owe this to all other favorable conditions.
You all have an idea of the traffic in Shanghai, a heavy traffic load for a complicated road network.
Decoded Preds:
But we're particularly happy, with more cars and more traffic, because only if you're stuck in traffic jams can you be confined to listening to our show.
Some people say no. I like to put on a flash drive and listen to my favorite song.
But nobody's angry.
And what's the greatest charm of the radio?
You never know what kind of song you're going to play next.
And then I made a point, put the song in its entirety.
Why do you say to put the song in its entirety?
Let me give you an example.
Decoded Labels:
But we would like it to be that way, as you would find yourselves trapped in the horrible traffic and could finally calm down to listen to our program.
Some people would argue that they prefer to play their favorite songs on a USB.
But I'd say it lacks human interaction.
Also what is the biggest charm of radio programs?
That is, you'll never know what's going to be played next.
One more thing, play the songs completely.
Why is that?
For example.
Decoded Preds:
We're here today to hear the speech, half the talk, and suddenly there's a power outage.
Or you and your lover, having dinner at a restaurant that you've been seeing for a long time, just at half, the waiter took your meal for some reason.
How do you feel?
The same goes for the music station.
What we're asking is that the song has to be played in its entirety.
Look at the list on the top, it's in the 59th, so the end of each of our songs is stuck at the 59th.
From the three songs of 16, 17 and 18 years, all can see.
Why is that?
Decoded Labels:
You come here today for the lecture, and the power goes off suddenly in the middle of my talk.
Or, you and your lover go eat in a restaurant which you tried to reserve for a long time, and the waitress just takes your plates away for no reason in the middle of the meal.
How would you feel in such situations?
It feels the same in music radio programs.
So we ask hosts to play songs in whole.
You may take a look at the playlist on the screen, in the FM101 we have to play songs till the very end marked by the 59th second in the clock.
And you may see it from the playlists in 2016, 2017 and 2018.
You may wonder why.
Decoded Preds:
It's to make sure that our songs don't, under any circumstances, be advertising, full-time reporting, weather forecasting, information, and interrupt the audience's mood for music.
Come down again and answer every private letter.
Personal letters, micro-letters, including software that we used to talk about like happy webs, interactive socialization.
Why do you have to answer?
Because the audience is our food and clothing parents, their needs are what we should meet.
For example, many listeners will ask: What's a song playing at what time?
I wasn't obliged to answer you.
I said, "You did, because you answered him, and he will come to you next time."
Decoded Labels:
It's because we have to make sure that under no circumstances should our program be disrupted and the mood of our audience should be bothered by commercials, on-time alarms, weather forecasts or any other information.
Moreover, we would reply to every comment you left.
Comments or WeChat messages, including messages on social medias like Kaixin001.
Why?
Because we have to satisfy the demands of our audience, as they are our clients for whom we are living.
Or some audience may ask: what was the name of the song you played at what time?
Many hosts used to ignore it, as they think it was not their obligation to respond.
But I would say that they do because the audience would come back next time.
Decoded Preds:
But next time he'll ask you what it means.
He's still listening to your show.
So our ideas have gradually evolved, from the old heights to the present, to the fact that we are you, with your good friends, with the value of our existence.
That is, one of the greatest purposes that we have now, on the entire radio station, is to do the job of being a companion.
Let all listeners think that the moderator is his friend, that the moderator can bring him the most fresh information, play the best song, and even give him a lot of good prizes and prizes.
In recent years, I have often been asked to say this.
You're old, and you're middle-aged, but moving 101 has always been one of the most up-to-date news and song frequencies, so how do you keep your young mind and mind?
There's not much to talk about, it's simple.
Decoded Labels:
What does it mean if he comes back to ask you about something?
It means that he is still listening to your program.
Hence, our attitudes change from indifference to being friends with the audience, keeping the audience company is the value of our existence.
Simply put, how to make a great companion is now the purpose of the whole radio station.
And make your audience feel that you are their friend, and that you can bring them the latest information, play them best songs, and give them lots of great prizes and bonuses.
Over the past few years, people would usually ask me.
It's been years and now you are almost a middle-aged man, how could you maintain such young mentality as FM101 has always been a trendy program of the latest information and popular songs?
And my answer would be very short and simple.
Decoded Preds:
Just find a young lady.
You know, it's funny, but my wife's not much younger than me.
Watch out for the tone in the brackets. It's young.
It's because, as we grow old, we read books, we watch movies, or we meet people, we change our minds, but we do the media, and we always keep the freshest eye on the market.
So, especially after I have moved to managerial positions in recent years, the willingness to engage in these matters has become smaller.
All of them were carried passively by my wife.
So what she looked at.
She read "China has hip-hop", she read "The Blood Street Dancers", then she read "Idols Practice" and she read "Creating 101. "
Decoded Labels:
By getting myself a "young" wife.
I know you would laugh, well, actually my wife is not that young.
Actually, I was referring to a young state.
Well, I think it's all because we as media workers should be sensitive to fresh and new information in the market, in spite of the fact that the books we read, the movies we see, and the people we interact with would change accordingly as we age.
So, later I find myself be less inclined to get exposed to new things, especially after I began to do management a few years ago.
So it is my wife who leds me to know the current trend and new stuff.
What TV programs does my wife watch?
The Rap of China, Hot-Blood Dance Crew, Idol Producer, and Produce 101.
Decoded Preds:
And I watched them all passively, so I was able to talk a lot about them.
Our audience is after 90, after 80, they know, I know, they don't even know.
So I feel like I'm particularly grateful on this stage for my wife who's been taking me along with her.
Well, that's some of the things I shared with you today, my professional experience.
I'd like to give you a little more and a little more inspiration.
I think I'm such a small person, a small person in the media.
I've been doing it since I was a kid, but I can make my biggest dream come true!
Thank you!
Decoded Labels:
As I passively watched each one of these shows with her, so that I could talk about it in my program.
Our audience was mainly the post-80s and the post-90s, so I know what they know and what they don't know.
Therefore, I think I should thank my wife for her efforts in forcing me to keep up with the society.
Well, that's what I'd like to share with you today, mainly about my career experience.
And I hope you would find it helpful.
I think I'm a small potato like I said today, a mere nobody in the media industry.
And by starting from the insignificant work, I could realize the dream of my life.
Thank you!

An American writer named Margaret Mead.
He wrote a book called Culture and Commitment.
She suggested that in human development.
Education is in fact divided into three stages.
And in the old agricultural society.
This education is called civilization.
Why, because there was little change in productivity in the past.
Every day, day by day, year by year, we all grow food and look at the sky.
Decoded Labels:
Margaret Mead, an American writer.
Wrote a book called "Culture and Commitment".
She proposed that in the development of mankind.
Education has gone through actually three phases.
In the agricultural society.
Education was called pre-figurative civilization.
In the past, the productivity almost remained the same.
Everyone planted food and predicted future climate every day.
Decoded Preds:
So whoever lives long enough has a better say.
So it was the seniors who raised the seniors.
So in the Chinese language, you'll find out.
We call it "teacher."
But after industrial civilization.
You'll see, it's changed again.
That's for engineers and technicians to learn from each other for one thing at the same time and to work together.
So the designer.
Decoded Labels:
So whoever lived for a longer time would have a larger say.
Therefore, at that time, seniors usually taught juniors what they ought to do.
That's why you would find that in the language of Chinese.
We call our teachers "Old Masters".
But later in the industrial civilization.
It changed again.
Engineers and technicians would learn from each other and help each other at the same time.
In terms of design.
Decoded Preds:
You have to have a designer, you have to have a structural engineer.
So Meade thinks it's called a culture of homogeneity.
Today's change is even greater.
My daughter was born in 1994.
Today I can make it very clear to you that I have a lot of knowledge that is no longer comparable to my daughter, because she lives completely in an Internet age.
And this time, at our age, people can't get used to it, to understand it.
To accept it.
In other words.
Decoded Labels:
You need to have a designer and a structural engineer.
So Mead called it the con-figurative civilization.
Today we've witnessed more changes.
My daughter was born in 1994.
Today I'm confident to say that I've lagged far behind my daughter in terms of what I know since she's been living in the Internet era.
People at my age couldn��t get accustomed to or understand it.
Nor would we accept it.
In other words.
Decoded Preds:
You young people here can teach us.
Today's event is called the Day of Thought.
That's from "I think I'm here" by Descartes.
But people who know French should know that.
Not that I thought I was there.
It's about saying, I doubt it, I'm here.
The concept of the Cartesian is that the world is skeptical and cannot be skeptical only of me.
The Age of Technology.
Decoded Labels:
Young people here could teach us one thing or two.
Today's event is called "Festival of Thought".
Which is derived from Descartes's "I think, therefore I am" or "Cogito, ergo sum" in Latin.
But in fact, people who are familiar with French know that when Descartes put those words.
He didn��t mean that "I think, so I am here".
Instead, what he meant is, "I doubt, therefore, I am".
What Descartes is trying to say is that everything in this world can be doubted, except the doubts of our own.
In the age of technology.
Decoded Preds:
How can we re-understand education, the technological age, and how can we create intuition?
My SMG came in two years ago from England with a play called War Horse.
This "The Horses of War" is the story of World War I.
I believe many young people don't know about the history of World War I.
How do you know that?
The Horses of War have adopted a way to increase your intuition, so you can understand it.
This horse is played by actors, not real horses.
But this horse has generated profound attention to the drama and indeed to the history.
Decoded Labels:
How do we re-understand education and wake up our intuition?
SMG, my employer, introduced a British drama called "War Horse" two years ago.
Which is a story that took place in World War I.
I believe that many young people don��t know about the history of World War I.
How do you know about it?
"War Horse" has provided you an intuitive experience to understand this history.
This horse, not a real one, was played by an actor.
But this horse has prompted people to pay attention to not only this drama but also this period of history.
Decoded Preds:
He found that the horse, in fact, was at the heart of the human being.
After this horse comes out, except for the ticket house.
It has also allowed many young people, even children, to begin to re-understand the history of World War I.
Let's see. It's under the stage. What did they do?
I believe there is no book that can match such a play.
There's no one who can tell a horse like this.
That's intuition.
So you can see World War I, and you can hear the voice of the people at World War I.
Decoded Labels:
He found that the core of the horse is actually people.
After the drama came out, it became a blockbuster.
Besides, it also allowed many young people and even children to re-understand the history of World War I.
Let's take a look at what they have done behind the scene?
I believe that there is no book that can be compared to a drama like this one.
No one can tell a story better than a horse played by people.
This is intuition.
Which helps you see the war and hear the voice of the people in World War I.
Decoded Preds:
Many people today say that the history of our time is behind this book.
In 2004, when I was covering the Athens Olympics, I went to Athens.
As a result, a large number of relevant secondary school students, from the United States, the United Kingdom and Europe, were seen in such a circular theatre.
I thought they were traveling.
I was told that they came to this place to learn about history.
History cannot leave reality.
History cannot leave the environment.
As we speak, emphasis is placed on having a context.
Decoded Labels:
Today, many people say that students learn history by reciting the textbook.
When I reported on the Athens Olympics in 2004, I went there.
In this circular theater, I saw a lot of middle school students from the United States, Britain and Europe.
I thought they were traveling.
Instead, they told me that they came here to learn history right on the spot.
History cannot be separated from reality.
Neither from the environment.
Just as when we speak, we cannot ignore the context.
Decoded Preds:
People talk to each other and stress the situation.
People need to be conscious when they choose their lives.
How many of us here can you go through your Chinese and world history in the way you do?
So, after studying, you almost forgot.
Let me give you an example!
What does artificial intelligence rely on in translating the logic of language?
There were three approaches.
The first is called grammar and word.
Decoded Labels:
When we socialize, we have to think about the situation.
When we make choices of life, we need to think big.
Have any of you used your own way to experience the history of China or the world?
Basically, you've forgotten what you've learned about history.
For example,
What logic is AI translation based on?
There used to be three types of logic.
First and foremost, grammar and words.
Decoded Preds:
Like, eat apples, me, eat apples.
"I" is the main word, "eat" is the word, and " apple" is the guest word.
We've been translating in this way for a long time.
So the earliest AI translation is based on this principle.
And did you find that the early translator was particularly difficult?
Like what?
The Chinese team won the United States team.
Who won?
Decoded Labels:
For instance, eat apples...I...eat...apples.
Here "I" is the subject, EAT is the predicate and APPLES is the object.
We've been translating this way for a long time.
The earliest version of AI-driven translation program was based on this principle.
Later you found that the earlier version of translation machine wasn't useful at all, right?
Take these sentences for example.
Chinese team won over American team.
Who has won?
Decoded Preds:
The Chinese team won.
The Chinese team defeated the American team.
Who won?
The Chinese team won.
The difference between a word and a word makes a difference.
You'll find that grammar is not working the way a word is.
Today, however, we learn languages through grammar and words.
So today we have a second way.
Decoded Labels:
Chinese team.
To Chinese team, American team lost.
Who has won?
Still Chinese Team.
The use of a different word makes all the difference.
You would find that to learn by grammar and words doesn't work anymore.
But today we still learn language by remembering grammar and words.
So today we have the second way, that is.
Decoded Preds:
It's about collecting everyone's feelings about this thing, and it's tending to mean it.
It's a linguistic concept.
Collect all your descriptions to really make you understand what it means.
For example, if you speak in Shanghai, don't be so cute!
If you use the original grammar and word, it makes you a little sicker?
Actually, it's not.
"Don't be too cute" and "Let's make you cute" is a meaning.
But there's another problem.
Decoded Labels:
To collect all people's perception of this matter.
Collective perception is a linguistic concept.
We collect all your descriptions to really make you understand what it means.
For example, if a person from Shanghai says, "Don��t be too cute!"
Following the logic of the original grammar and words, does it mean you need to be a little bit despicable?
In fact, it's not.
"Don't be too cute" is the same as "you��re so cute".
So here is another problem.
Decoded Preds:
We need to take more models to understand what it means.
I've met a lot of good literature.
Like Prost's Reminiscent Year.
So there may be no relevant off-the-shelf language here to explain it.
How are we supposed to understand this?
What's the point?
Okay, artificial intelligence has developed a third way today, called cross-media reasoning.
Let us give an example.
Decoded Labels:
We need to collect more context to better understand it.
There are a lot of good classic literature.
Iike Prost's "In Search of Lost Time".
If there are no relevant ready-made languages to explain it.
How do we understand it?
By emphasizing on its artistic context?
Well, then artificial intelligence has developed into the third stage today called Cross-Media Reasoning.
I'll give you an example.
Decoded Preds:
Three things, now I have images, graphics, colors, sounds.
What's it doing?
All of you, there was just a sound, a circle and a red.
What's going on?
Our imagination has been destroyed by our education.
Eat apples!
Is that not the basic logic of our education?
To inspire your logic, to inspire your association, to inspire your intuition, to make it easier for you to understand the essence of the problem.
Decoded Labels:
There are three things here, images, colors and sounds.
What is it doing?
Just now there were a voice, a circle and something red.
What is it doing?
Our imagination is really impaired by our education.
Eat Apples!
Isn't the logic of artificial intelligence translation the same as the logic of our education?
It makes it easier for you to understand the nature of issues when your imagination and intuition are sparkled.
Decoded Preds:
When Mr. Shen was a language teacher.
First class for the students.
Not to teach the ancient history of literature in China, but to give you language about what the air is like in this house.
All our lives today are in the concept of our words.
Can you understand death?
We used to say, "Oh, my God, that's what death is all about!"
I'll show you a series of portraits of death taken by a photographer.
When I put all the pictures on the back of the screen, you find it very shocking.
Decoded Labels:
Mr. Shen Congwen was once a Chinese language teacher.
In the first lesson.
He would always let his students describe what the air in the room was like instead of teaching his students the history of Chinese ancient literature.
Today we're living in the concepts of words and languages.
Do you understand death?
We used to say,death is just like this or that...
But if I show the series of portraits of death by a photographer.
If I put all those pictures on the screen, you will be impressed and shocked.
Decoded Preds:
He took pictures of this man one minute before his death, and after his death, and used such photographs as if there was no life left.
I used this photo in an international nursing conference in Shanghai.
The people at the scene, it's very shocking.
Thanks to the German photographer, he filmed hundreds of people.
This association is by no means self-evident in terms of language.
So sometimes I have to even come to the conclusion that the later you read, the sooner you learn.
Because the book largely destroys your intuition and destroys your association.
I did a show last year called Midway Poetry.
Decoded Labels:
The photographer shot a picture of one person one minute before he died and after he died to show the passing of one life.
I used this photo in the International Nursing Conference hosted in Shanghai.
The people on the scene felt very shocked.
I want to thank the German photographer for shooting pictures of hundreds of people.
By no means could such an association be clarified through simply words.
Sometimes I even come to the conclusion that the later you read, the sooner you will be enlightened.
The reason is that textbooks have destroyed your intuition and wiped out your capability to associate to a great extent.
I made a TV show last year called "Poetry of China".
Decoded Preds:
A lot of people like it, think it's cute, put a lot of families together, write poems.
But we used to read poems on the basis of an understanding of words.
But did you really imagine that you could turn it into a graphical way of social science?
One of the Wang teachers at the University of the South-Central Nation marked the path of all poets through the 100-degree map.
You'll find out why Li Bai is so cold.
Why is Duve so sad? Why do you think Su-yun is so upset?
It's got to do with the way he went.
So I came to a conclusion.
Decoded Labels:
The show was well-received because it gathered lots of families to recite poetry.
We used to recite poetry based on the its literal meaning.
But have you ever thought about reciting via graphics of social science?
A professor from the South-Central Minzu University marked the roads all poets travelled before on Baidu Map.
You shall find out the reason of why Li Bai is so desolate.
Du Fu so sad, and Su Shi so philosophical?
It has something to do with the roads he has travelled.
So I came to a conclusion.
Decoded Preds:
Not far, no poetry.
No love, no poetry.
Likewise, in such a poem, "Swimming" we have been back ever since we were young.
But if you don't have the background to this poem, your understanding of this poem is that it's a child who has just learned to speak, beginning to feel his gratitude to his mother.
How can he understand how the mother and the child feel without even leaving the baby?
This poem is a 46-year-old in Mon suburb of the Stearns.
He lived in extreme poverty at the age of 52.
He was sent to Xiangyang, Jiangsu province.
Decoded Labels:
You have no sense of poetry without travelling afar.
You have no sense of poetry without feeling genuinely.
Also, we learned the poem called A Troubadour's Lament as we were young.
If you have no clue about the background of this poem, you would think that it is about a kid feeling grateful for his/her mother.
But for a kid like you, if you have never been far away from your mother, how is it possible for you to actually feel that gratitude?
This poem is about Mengjiao who only became a Advance Scholar at the age of 46.
He was extremely destitute when he was 52 years old.
He was dispatched to Fuyang, Jiangsu Province.
Decoded Preds:
He wrote it when he was a little officer.
He is 52 years old and has been away from home for almost 30 years.
I've always wanted to be developed.
But now it's just a ninesome.
He remembers the mother he never saw.
I always thought when he left home, he told his mother that I'd come to see you when I got better.
But his mother's hair is pale.
The original of this poem is called "Ahead of the Mother" in the water, and I greet my mother.
Decoded Labels:
He wrote the poem when he was a small official there.
He was 52 years old and had been away from home for nearly 30 years.
He had been hoping to be successful.
However, he was only an official of ninth grade at that time.
He remembered he hadn't seen his mother for a long time.
When he left his hometown, he told his mother that "I will come to see you once I succeed".
Waiting for her son for a long time, his mother had already been a grey-haired woman.
The original title of this poem is Meet Mother at Lishui.
Decoded Preds:
Cassidy's got the line, Zoot's coat.
It's so close that I'm afraid I'll be late.
Whosoever has a plan, shall be rewarded with three springs.
If it wasn't for a 52-year-old, would you understand the sadness of the heart of Mon suburban writing this poem?
Did you go back to see your mother?
Look at this poem!
My friend, Professor Yoo of Qinghua University, has a very good sentence.
I'd like to copy this place today.
Decoded Labels:
Sewing threads in my kind Mother's hand; She was shuttling through a coat for me, a wayward boy.
She sewed them before seeing me off neatly closed; for fear that I might return much too lately.
How can a blade of grass return the favor of the spring sun?
If you're not at the age of 52 like Mengjiao, how is it possible that you can understand the sadness of Mengjiao when he wrote the poem?
Have you paid visits to mother after you travelled afar?
Check out this poem!
My friend, Professor Liu Yu from Tsinghua University has said something really great.
I am willing to copy it here today.
Decoded Preds:
She said that we believed in the essence of the university spirit not to make us deeper, but to restore the innocence of humankind.
It is innocent people who ask endless questions about the world, about nature, about society.
Only naive can you be Orwell.
Only naive can you be Einstein.
Only naive can you be Li Bai and Tupp.
Do you still have this naive today?
Humankind was divided into three parts in the logical world.
We are familiar with the natural world and the human world.
Decoded Labels:
She said, "The nature of the spirit of the university is to make human beings innocent rather than esoteric."
Only the innocent people would continually ask questions about the world, nature and society.
Only with innocence can you become George Orwell.
And only with innocence can you become Einstein.
only with innocence can you become Li Bai or Du Fu.
Do you still keep that piece of innocence to you?
Human beings have divided the logical world into three parts.
We are familiar with the natural world and the human world.
Decoded Preds:
So, as we said when we were little, we wanted two worlds that were subjective and objective.
The knowledge of the natural world is passed on to humanity, and it forms the natural sciences.
Human knowledge, changing nature through its own behaviour, forms what is called engineering technology.
Human beings fuck each other and become social sciences.
Today we have a third world, called the Information World.
Our understanding of the world today is more than that.
It has even changed, and we have done it through the information world.
The information world, too, has changed our lives.
Decoded Labels:
As we said when we were young, we had two worlds, one subjective and one objective.
The knowledge of the natural world, which has passed on to humans, forms Natural Science.
Human beings change nature through their own actions, and the knowledge gained forms what is called Engineering Technology.
The result of people changing each other becomes Social Science.
Now we have the third world, the information world.
Our knowledge of the world, not just the knowledge.
But also the changes are carried out through information world.
The information world is also changing our lives.
Decoded Preds:
But it is independent of our original human and physical world.
Think like that, if you don't understand.
It's hard for you to really understand what we should do with today's education.
Today's education isn't about who's born to be a teacher.
It's about you starting to build an information world, where you have to learn and teach.
Why do we have to learn?
We're not just trying to learn something.
What we need to learn more is this mindset of thinking.
Decoded Labels:
But it's independent from our original human and physical world.
If you don't understand what the way of thinking means.
It is very difficult for you to realize what we should do to today's education.
In today's education, no one is born to be the teacher of someone else.
You start to build a world of information where you must learn and teach at the same time.
Why do we need to learn?
We don't just learn about a certain concept.
We're learning to acquire a way of how we think about issues.
Decoded Preds:
In a word, I would like to advise all of you to listen to my speech today.
Of course it's also a wake-up call for myself.
He said we had a lot of analysis, a lot of learning.
It's just that we've used concepts that are well known to some to surround beauty, but we've never come to beauty.
Is everything you know about the world based on your concept?
Is your knowledge of all this knowledge based on the concepts you've learned in your books?
I think it's not just natural science, it's social science that requires us to understand more strongly, through our way, what philosophy is, what sociology is, what psychology is, what literature is.
Do you have the technology to create an opportunity for people to experience it?
Decoded Labels:
I would like to quote a saying of Bergson to leave you something to think about.
Of course, this is also a wake-up call for me.
He said, in many of our analysis and study.
We've used some commonly known perception to surround beauty but never have we reached it.
Is your understanding of the world also based on your concepts?
Is all your understanding of knowledge based on concepts you've learned from textbooks?
Besides Natural Science, in the case of Social Science, we also need to deepen our understandings of what philosophy, sociology, psychology, and literature is by our own methods.
Do you have such technology to create opportunities for people to experience?
Decoded Preds:
Not long ago, I went to America and ran into Zuckerberg's sister, Randy Zuckerberg.
She told me that everybody's running a marathon now, and they're half-dead.
If you run again, you'll have to find a rabbit instead.
As a result, a new software was developed and installed on this cell phone called "You follow the run, the zombies come."
It is a hybrid reality process.
Where you're going, you'll find a zombie on this side of the road, and you're getting ready to jump in and eat you.
As a result, people were running harder and less expensive for rabbits.
Art is constantly responsible for exploring the boundaries of human expression.
Decoded Labels:
Not long ago, I went to the U.S. and encountered the sister of Mark Zuckerberg, Randi Zuckerberg.
She told me that now no one likes to run a marathon because it was too exhausting.
You would need to be as energetic as a rabbit to finish the marathon.
Later, she developed a new app called "Run Fast, Zombies Are Coming."
It's a game based on Mixed Reality.
You might go somewhere and find a zombie on the roadside ready to grab and eat you.
So people would run as fast as possible, saving the money they have to pay for the rabbits if they want rabbits to replace them.
The purpose of arts is to explore the boundaries of human expression.
Decoded Preds:
But the technology now offers it all the possibilities.
We have a play in SMG these past two years.
I don't know if anyone's seen it.
Sleep No More, No Sleeping, that's a immersed play.
There's no way this plays anymore. It's a script. You can see it in two-dimensional ways.
It turns into you coming in from that place any minute.
You go with any actor, you're watching a different scene from tomorrow's.
As you can see, the panoramic camera shows up.
Decoded Labels:
And now the current state of technology is capable of providing all sorts of possibilities.
SMG introduced a drama these 2 years.
I don't know if any of you have checked it out.
It is called Sleep No more, a type of immersive drama.
It is unconventional, not like the traditional plays that allows you to enjoy through a two-dimentional playbook.
It is based on scenarios.
If you follow different actors or actresses, you have different experiences and see different plays.
You could also discover that with the emergence of panoramic cameras and the 3D cameras.
Decoded Preds:
It's our tradition to believe that the two-dimensional movie of Montaic will be broken in 10 years.
Because there's gonna be a fully immersed movie.
But the test for us people is when we make this movie.
How do we make this up? Where do we put our cameras?
We all believe that all our humanities are designed to nurture a solid mindset.
But I conclude by saying that all education is not good if it is not aimed at nurturing human diversity.
In other words, diversity of thinking is even a good premise.
Today's technology is to make each of us feel the world differently in everyone's eyes, through our own feelings, our intuitions.
Decoded Labels:
We believe that the montage of two-dimensional movies will be overshadowed within ten years.
Because there will be a type of fully immersive movies.
But the test for us is when we shoot the films.
How do we frame the stories and where do we place the cameras?
We all believe that the education of human culture is to cultivate a stereotype of mindset.
But for me, I think all education, if not provided to cultivate a pluralistic mindset, is a vice.
In other words, a pluralistic mindset is the pre-condition of kindness.
Today's technology has allowed us to experience other people's worlds through resonance or intuition.
Decoded Preds:
So that you can become more inclusive and more kind.
Thank you all!
