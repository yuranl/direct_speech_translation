## Simple Baseline Howto (for Wave File input)
1. Prepare a short piece of wave file (google interface complains about too long input; any input larger than 10.0mb would be rejected, but shorter ones too). The "chunk2.wav" is our example.
2. Install related packages: pydub, gtts, googletrans, SpeechRecognition (imported as speech_recognition).
3. Run the .py and observe the results on the output wave file.
4. NOTE: for text translation, just using google Translator performs great.
