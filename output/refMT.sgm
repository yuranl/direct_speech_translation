<seg id=1>Good afternoon everyone!With the Internet technologies being highly developed.Today we can send conveniently a joke, a picture or a video through WeChat to a family member or a friend.10 GB of data could even be sent out within only one minute.But there are also some things not so easy to be sent.Say, transferring ten US dollars to your friend in the US might prove very challenging for you.That's because assets like US dollars are irreproducible and their peer-to-peer transmission must be credit-based.So how do we make credit work in our real life?Most of the times we depend on intermediaries such as the government and banks.All those intermediaries constitute the basis of the social credit system.Generally they are very good at their work.And that earns them the title "omnipotent intermediaries".But problems still exist.For example, cross-border remittance, as I just mentioned.Is always known for its low efficiency and high cost.Another example is, suppose one day you buy a house and the next day you may wake up being sieged by crowds zealously ready to offer you help in redecorating it.Obviously your private information has been leaked.So those intermediaries can also turn out to be very unreliable.Is there a possibility that we could use some technology to optimize and even reconstruct the basis of the social credit system?In 2008, a hacker named Satoshi Nakamoto released a peer-to-peer electronic cash system.This system, after being launched on line,was cheered by hacker groups and all kinds of gray organizations such as those that run gambling and money laundering business."Bitcoin System", that's its name.The value of bitcoins has surged by a million times in the past eight years.That may suggest a high possibility of speculation.But it's hard to deny that bitcoins indeed have some essential value.Let's look closely and see how the bitcoin transactions are different from traditional money transfer services conducted by banks.The left side of the screen shows us how the banks perform money transfers, which we are very familiar with.Banks work as a reliable intermediary to make credit work at its best.The entire process, in which banks, like a bookkeeper.Deduct some money from the account A and add the money to the account B, is quite simple.The right side of the screen displays how the bitcoin transfers work.It's more complicated, and I'll explain it a little bit.When A is transferring bitcoins to B.Information of this transaction will be sent to all the nodes of the bitcoin network through the P2P technology.Then all the nodes will use a consensus algorithm to check the validity of the transaction.The result of each node's check will then be sent through the P2P technology to all the other nodes.The nodes will jointly analyze the results of the check, authenticate and record the transaction.The entire process depends on algorithms to achieve a consensus and thus builds its own credit system.It works like an online ledger.Involving all the nodes of the network at the same time.And what's most important.You may find that intermediaries are no longer needed here.That's also why financial institutions in recent two years are swarming to study this technology that might be a game changer in future.This technology is the blockchain.It is in general composed of five technologies.P2P technologies, consensus algorithms, blockchain construction, smart contracts and cryptography.Those five technologies are not newly invented and they have actually existed for many years.But combined together, they burst into a magical chemical reaction and create a new-type credit system.It's just like ten years ago, when Steve Jobs compounded the cell phone, the iPod and the browser technology, iPhone came out.As a provider of the third-party payment system for years.We have combined our decades of expertise with the blockchain ideologies and the peculiarities of many businesses we've met in practice, and independently invented a new blockchain system.Which is based on database and named TrustSQL.As we see it, blockchain should be considered as a very basic technology for connection.As a reliable technology, it could be used to tackle the problems with the intermediaries I mentioned earlier.Based on it, very specific, practical measures and applications can be proposed and implemented.They could then be optimized and even be used to enhance mutual trust between institutions or businesses.In this way, the collaboration between different organizations will be more trustworthy, more efficient and less expensive.And thus the largest possible value might be created.So how exactly does the technology work?Many people will associate the blockchain with the bitcoin, and some even define the blockchine as a tool in finance.But let's try something different today.Suppose someone in your family goes missing.Can you think of a faster way to find him or her?We all hear of some philanthropic organizations who can help look for the missing people.But because they usually ask for registration and authentication, controversies rage over the security of the registration information, the ownership of the data and the protection of privacy.Which leads to a wavering mutual trust between all those organizations.In that manner, each organization is actually made into a highly isolated island of information.What's the problem with that?I'll give you an example.If a child gets lost.It usually requires an interval of several hours between inputting information at the first node and then doing that at the second node.During the interval.Perhaps the missing child may happen to come within the reach of the loudspeaker of the second node.Or this child might have already been found and taken home for dinner.But those organizations who are looking for the child don't know this.They keep searching and thus cause a huge waste of resources.This year in April.Together with "Baobeihuijia" and the "404 Not-Found project".We used our TrustSQL sharing-ledger solution and constructed a philanthropic finding-the-missing-people chain.Any information input at one node could be shared throughout the entire chain.Thus problems like the "isolated islands" could be avoided.And the work of looking for missing people could be more efficient and transparent.Take something that happened around me.Half a month ago.A high-school classmate of mine.Terribly uneasy, came to me and told me his father, who was very old, went lost.I remember it was the afternoon of August 14th.We immediately got him registered and authenticated that very night.And the next day, at noon.Good news came through his happy tone.His father was back—even much faster than he had imagined.Neither had we thought he could be found within such a short period.Later when we were investigating the whole thing.We found that it was the "Moments" of WeChat that circulated the information of the missing old man that helped us find him.That's to say, when we were registering on "Baobeihuijia" website that night.The node at WeChat immediately captured the information about my classmate's missing father, sent it out and spread it by means of its "Moments".Luckily, the old man was recognized by someone who had seen the information.That's why we could find him so quickly.Small as the case might sound, the charm of the blockchain was profoundly felt and revealed here.It can make our society more heartwarming.That is a small case.Now let's see something bigger.Once a notorious question was posed, which went, "How can you prove that the woman you call "mom" is your real mother?"It caused a huge uproar.When we were developing our blockchain technology, a thought constantly occurred to us that actually in our whole life, from our birth to our old age.We are also always urged to prove our identity—our existence, growth and capabilities.Why am I saying that?Because we are applying for certificates all the time, such as the student ID cards, birth certificates and property ownership certificates.Those certificates cost us huge amounts of time and money, and bring us many troubles.If the authentication applications of the blockchain could be used, then we would be able to combine all those information behind the certificates in a digital identity chain, and get an all-purpose certificate once and for all.Perhaps we'll just need to register our fingerprints and then be authenticated to exploit related data to prove our own identity.In that sense, I guess the "proving the identity of your mother" conundrum might finally vanish.In that sense, I guess the "proving the identity of your mother" conundrum might finally vanish.Earlier this year there was a very popular TV drama named "In the Name of People".It began with an official surnamed Zhao being caught grafting 100 million RMB.When I was watching this.I couldn't help thinking that.If in future all the assets like cash could be digitized and placed in the blockchain.Whose data are unalterable but trackable, then perhaps the anti-corruption conundrum haunting Chinese history for thousands of years would finally be effectively solved.To sum up, we have used several cases today to focus on three benefits the blockchain will bring to us.And we will find that the blockchain is offering another possibility to our world in future.That is well demonstrated by the fact that the block chain can optimize the basis of our social credit system.We used to build houses with wood and stones.But now we have shifted to steel and concrete.The blockchain is just like steel and concrete in the online world.It will build a more harmonious and solid bond between people, organizations and even countries, thereby making their cooperation more efficient and transparent, and helping them create more value for the society.As long as we can break through our mental barriers, dare to try, and harbor integrity and love in our heart.We'll be able to make the blockchain shine like a bright star.Thank you.</seg>
<seg id=2>Good evening, my friends!Today, I want to talk about why we shouldn't oppose Genetic Modification technology.This is a popular topic.Before I deliver my speech.Let's make a small choice together.So suppose you're given two kinds of food.The genetically modified food, and the biotech food.Put up your hand if you're willing to choose the genetically modified food.Well, it seems few people put up their hands.And put up your hand if you're willing to select the biotech food.Ok, I see more hands this time.The truth is the genetically modified food and biotech food are the same food.And they are made by using the same technology.So my friends.We can't blindly oppose the genetically modified technology.Well, there was a time when some people thought that the GM food was an American conspiracy against Chinese people and that whoever consumed it would gradually become infertile and  Chinese would die out in the end.This is a conspiracy theory.But is this a real conspiracy?In fact, in the United States, ordinary people all eat the GM food.Why?In the US, there are more than 2,000 different GM foods in the market, and the foods don't have to carry a GM label.This is to say, they do not know these are the GM foods.In my opinion.Americans must have been the first to taste the GM food as the US is the first to produce such food, right?If so, will Americans lose fertility eventually?Obviously, this is not the case.Driven by the conspiracy theory, a campaign against the GM food was launched in China, with the aim of protecting the Chinese people, or "the descendants of the dragon".On the contrary.This January, the United States allowed the sales of the insect-resistant genetically modified rice, or the IRGM rice that is quite unpopular in China.What does that mean?This means that the IRGM rice can be eaten and sold in the United States.And this renders the so-called conspiracy theory groundless.You see, Americans themselves introduce and consume the IRGM rice.So the conspiracy theory and campaign appear quite ridiculous now, right?Why is that?I'll show you an example.I believe all of us in this studio like high-speed train, right?High-speed train is the pride of China.I think all of us are willing to have a long-distance trip by high-speed train and we are all happy to enjoy the speed, convenience and comfort it brings.But do you know there was a similar movement against the train more than 100 years ago when it was first introduced in China?As you can see from the picture here.A group of people were talking about the devastating effects of the train on the "dragon vein".Then the movement was launched to "destroy the rail and protect the dragon vein".As we see it now, the movement is quite ridiculous.Maybe after another 20 years.we will find our protest against the GM ridiculous, too.From my perspective.We shouldn't launch the ridiculous campaign against the GM food.Then you may ask what exactly genetic modification is.Well, first I want to introduce the concept of the gene.Simply speaking, a gene is a sequence of ribonucleic acid with a genetic function.So what is genetic modification?What is it?In fact.We can see it both as a technology and a process.To put it simply.genetic modification is a technology that transfers the genes from one species to another.In other words.It is a process through which the genes of one species are transferred to another species through some media.That's why we say it is both a process and a technology.So we have to think about what it is that we oppose.The process or the technology, right?Well, of course, a gene is modified through some media, or as we can say, by natural hybridization.In fact, human beings have noticed natural hybridization produces a lot of new varieties.And we have also learned to conduct artificial hybridization.Now, we can achieve genetic modification with biotech.So the process of modifying the genes becomes increasingly advanced.This is a technical point of view.We can also consider it from the perspective of process.The genetically modified process can actually occur between different individuals of the same species.But it can also occur between individuals of different species.In fact, it is a process of transferring genes, and this requires a medium.Well, I am quite passionate about photography and taking photos.So I often venture out in order to discover how different insects serve as a medium to transfer genes between different species or between different flowers.This is the natural genetic modification.The following picture is also an example of natural genetic modification.For example.We plant purple corns here, beside which white corns are planted.If the wind blows the pollen of the purple corn to the white corn.What color will the new variety bear?Just think about it.Ok, black and white, purple and white, the answers are quite reasonable.As we can see.It produces a variety of this color.Apparently, it is different from the white one, and it becomes much more colorful, right?So GM is a process of creative mutation.Which gives our breeders more choices.This is what we call the natural genetic modification.In fact, breeders try hard to obtain more such genetic variation.So that they can screen the best genes for cultivating and developing quality varieties.Such as improving its quality, its resistance to insects or diseases and other qualities.Actually, we can also achieve mutations with radiation.For example, this picture shows space breeding.In the process, the seeds are sent to space with the rocket and after the cosmic radiation, they undergo mutations.Mutation can also be achieved through the so-called cell hybridization by integrating different cells.However, this kind of mutation is a random process so it takes a lot of time for a singel mutation to be done.The genetic modification we talk about today, or we have talked the most about, is actually achieved by biotech.With biotech.we can cultivate genetically modified papaya and cotton.So let's take a look at how the genes are modified.As we just mentioned, there is natural hybridization, but it is quite random.Artificial hybridization may also be random.So what if we want it to precisely target and transfer the genes we want?Well, first we have to find a "car", or a carrier called plasmid.We have a small cut in the plasmid, and we can put the targeted gene in it.Then, the plasmid serves as a taxi and takes the gene to a bacterium.Then it multiplies from one to numerous copies.So that it can interact with the cells whose genes we need to transfer.In this process, we can find out that the gene on the plasmid can flow to the cell, and can even squeeze into the nucleus to integrate itself with the chromosome of the cell.Finally, a different white callus is cultivated.Then the callus is cultivated to grow into a seedling and then a seed.This way, the seed contains genetically modified genes and thus we develop a genetically modified plant.As we can see, this process is actually consistent with our traditional goal of passing on quality genes.But it is faster, more accurate, and more efficient.Then let’s discuss another question.Why shouldn't we oppose genetic modification?Well, we all know that it is a very tough task to ensure that people all over the world have enough food to eat.Let's look at the curves.The orange curve shows population growth trend.And the blue dotted curve behind it shows the two possibilities for food production.If we adopt high technology and make good use of the land, the grain growth may follow the above curve.Which means food production can meet the needs of population growth.But if we don't adopt such technology.We will encounter a huge gap in our food supply and such a gap will bring about many problems.Let's elaborate on it.The Chinese character 'Fan', or rice, consists of the left and right parts.What's the left?It's 'Shi', meaning food or to eat.And what's the right?It's 'Fan' or rebellion.So taking the two parts together.We can see if we can't guarantee food security, social turmoil might occur.Population expansion poses a serious problem and it puts tremendous pressure on our food security.What's exacerbating the situation is the process of urbanization.Because the infrastructure construction also takes up a lot of land.This photo was taken 30 years ago somewhere in Shanghai.Well, can any of you recognize where it is?Well, a same set of photos were taken 20 years later almost in the same place.Can you recognize it this time?These are the photos.Can any of you recognize where it is?Yes, it seems everyone knows it’s Pudong, isn’t it?From the photos, we can see clearly that the former quality fields gave way to highways, or urban areas.So urbanization takes up a lot of land.China hopes to save 1.8 billion mu of such land.But it has been a very difficult task so far.In fact, we still face many problems.Such as increasingly diminishing resources and the volatile global climate.For example, we may say Shanghai is surrounded by water but you may fail to realize that Shanghai is in a shortage of drinking water.The scarcity of such resources brings about a lot of problems.What’s worse, we are still tasked with increasing the output of food to ensure that nobody would suffer from hunger.What should we do?Can we try to expand the area of cultivated land?It will definitely not work in China.So maybe we can spray more pesticides and use more fertilizers.But do you really want to do this?The food produced by the pesticides and fertilizers will eventually be eaten by you.So I believe you are definitely not willing to do so.This method can't be adopted in China either.Because the ecological environment of our farmlands has already suffered from severe damage.So the only option is to draw on the rich genetic resources, and combine them with our new biotechnology, including the genetically modified technology.In this way, we produce more food in a speedy, accurate, and efficient manner.As I mentioned earlier, each year 2 million tons of pesticides will be sprayed into the farmland in China.Just imagine what will the 2 million tons of pesticides cause?But now we have an alternative technology at hand, that is the insect-resistant genetically modified rice or IRGM rice.Look at this picture, the IRGM rice grows well.Under the condition in which no pesticide is sprayed.There is a big difference between the IRGM rice and the ordinary rice which is not insect-resistant.We can say that our traditional way aims to transfer a useful gene, like the white ball, to a better variety.But it is a time-consuming and inaccurate process.But the aim of transferring useful genes can also be realized by our current method.Which is a more efficient and accurate approach, and even overcomes the reproductive barrier.For example, the traditional approach of hybridization is quite helpless if we want to transfer the drought-resistant gene of the drought-resistant Populus euphratica to rice.But this transfer can be easily achieved with biotech and the GM technology.We can say that the GM technology is quite useful.Some people may ask, despite all its merits, does the GM technology have any side effects?Well, as a new technology, the GM technology does have some problems.Which should be solved through our efforts.Just as an old saying goes, "Food is the first and paramount necessity of people".The first public concern is whether the GM food is safe and whether it will have side effects such as causing illness.And will it pose a threat to the environment?Apart from the health and environment issues.People may also worry about whether we should attach GM labels to the foods so that our right of knowing and choosing is defended.Other concerns may involve whether laws and regulations will be promulgated to regulate these things.In fact.China has laws and regulations in place for GM foods.Moreover, a GM product can be produced and commercialized only after it passes the stringent safety assessments in every stage from its development to its production.For this reason.International agencies believe that GM foods or products are safe.The UNFAO also believes that GM products are safe and legal.Because it is operated under the global framework of GM technology.Ok, We've just talked about the reasons for not opposing genetic modification.So now I want to discuss why we Chinese should be the last to campaign against GM foods.GM technology has been used globally for nearly 20 years.During this period.Texpansion to 180 million hectares or roughly about 2.7 or 2.8 billion mu.The above green line represents the overall cultivation area of GM foods.The blue line shows the cultivation area in developed countries.And the red line refers to the developing countries.This shows that developing countries have exceeded developed countries in terms of the cultivation area.The whole world is increasing the cultivation area, but it's a different case in China.As you can see,  we ranked fourth in 2002, and then moved downwards to the fifth place, then to sixth, and to the eighth.Actually, this rank is very inconsistent with the status of our country.Here is a set of data.In 2001, China ranked fourth, following the United States, Canada, and Argentina.But after 2003, we were surpassed by Brazil, and in 2007, we ranked sixth, surpassed by India.What a pity!India used to be a cotton importer.But the use of GM technology has transformed it into a cotton exporter.As the statistics show, China has lagged far behind India.For many years, China maintained the sixth place, and many small countries were trying to catch up.Then in 2016, China slid to the eighth place, even surpassed by Paraguay and Pakistan.At first, I was wondering how come Paraguay could closely follow China in the rank for about 10 years.Later, I found Paraguay was a very small country in South America, with a population of only 6 million.A country with a 1.4 billion population and a country with a 6 million population.Considering the huge difference in population, the rank doesn't match our national image and our national status.This echoes a Chinese saying."In sailing against the current, we must keep forging ahead or we will keep falling behind".Apart from being a lucrative technology, genetic modification is also a technological high ground.If we don't seize it, other countries will definitely occupy it.When we are still arguing whether we should develop or adopt GM technology.Many countries have crept up and surpassed us.I think this is a severe and worrying phenomenon.And food security is also a very important issue.China has to import 100 million tons of grain annually.It's 100 million tons of grain.What does that mean?It means that every Chinese has to import 70 kilograms of food on average.What if the countries refuse to export to us one day?Then this will cause a big problem, right?So if we continue to refrain from developing GM technology.We will definitely lose a good opportunity.In fact, we had a glorious history of the production of GM foods.We made such success in our genetically modified cotton, which not only saved our cotton industry.But also showed a remarkable, eye-catching Chinese image to the whole world.Before the production of genetically modified papaya, farmers could do nothing to combat the virus.But today we could see their smile when they harvest the virus-resistant GM cotton.It's at this moment that we feel the technology is so creative that it brings happiness to us.I hope that our technology will make our life better.Thank you!</seg>
<seg id=3>Hi, everyone.I am Chen Shaoqi, a musician from Hong Kong. I was kind of expecting some applause as encouragement here.In fact, this is just a little trick of mine. If I did not get any applause for my speech. Then at least the organizer can edit this at the end of my speech.The topic I want to share with you today is "the Creation of An Era".Which is about my experience in the musical industry for the past 32 years.And some reflections on creation.It will be divided into four parts.The first part is the path to creation.Which is about what I have been doing since 1985, and who I am.The second part is about some of my other artistic creations, including photography, painting and so on, in addition to music.The third part is about some of the methods and techniques that I appreciate.The final part is about slow living and the attitude towards creation.I will talk about these four parts.Please look at these pictures for a few more seconds. Although I have been in this business for 32 years.Some people still mistake me for a woman when hearing my name.Therefore, please look at these pictures for a few more seconds.The first part: the road to creation.I was quite lucky. In 1984 and 1985, two of my friends, Liu Yida and Huang Yaoming, were forming a boy band. I volunteered to write some lyrics for them.In the following one or two years.We recorded many demos and sent them to different record companies.Soon, the band was chosen and signed by one record company. The band name was changed to “Daming yipai”.At that time, the compositions, the lyrics, and the MV style of Daming yipai.And the styling of the band members were so ahead of the time that they more or less shocked the contemporary music world.I was also very fortunate, for this reason.I quickly got the attention from many established singers.At that time, Alan Tam, Leslie Cheung, Anita Mui, and Jacky Cheung all invited me to write lyrics for them.In the following 10, 15, or 20 years.I wrote lyrics for about two or three thousand songs in Hong Kong. And transformed slowly from a lyricist to a producer and planner of concerts, songs, and albums.2005 was a turning point for my career.At that time, music industry in the mainland just began to take off. I was invited by many people to do music projects in Beijing and Shanghai I must confessed that I felt a little upset by the situation at the time. What situation?At that time, I searched the music chart on Baidu Music. Among the top 100 songs, only 8 or 10 songs, probably even less, were Cantonese songs.Sometimes none of songs written by me would appear on the chart for one month, two months, or even half a year.Therefore, I searched for the chart of the top 500 classic songs. Some of my works were on the chart, mostly classic Cantonese songs from the 1980s and 1990s.This set me to think whether I should make more efforts to get my position in this market. A market which was completely strange to me..At the time, I was 40 years old, an age which seemed too old to start all over again and too young to retire.However, I did not choose to give up. In 2006 and 2007, I opened a studio in Beijing.I was quite fortunate that I participated in the creation of some public service songs for some large-scale events such as the 2008 Olympic Games and 2010 World Expo.I was very lucky that in 2008, Drawing Heart, the theme song that I created for the film Painted Skin. Also received lots of attention and won many prizes.The next ten years, from 2008 to this year, our studio did many business activities in addition to music production. Some of our business had nothing to do with music.For example advertising, endorsement,  concerts, or the shooting of MVs.We cooperated extensively with Disney.Including the theme song for the opening ceremony of Shanghai Disneyland, which I produced in collaboration with Mr. Tan Dun.However, in all the music projects, my favorite form of performance is musicals.In 1997, I worked as a screenwriter for Jacky Cheung’s musical Snow. Wolf. Lake and wrote about a quarter of the lyrics and a song for the play.Last year, 2017, was the 20th anniversary of Snow. Wolf. Lake.I wrote all the lyrics for the musical Fengyun, produced by Ma Rongcheng, a great cartoonist from Hong Kong.You have probably watched the movie Fengyun.Last year, the production of this musical introduced me to lots of new technologies.Such as stage performance art by using high-tech means like water, fire, video, and new forms of production.At the end of this year, I am going to produce my first musical, Love in Starlight, in collaboration with SMGLive.In fact, "Starlight" is a pun. It is the name of a community located in an old lane.In numerous kinds of musical performances, why do I like musicals the most?The second part of this speech will explain it.Trans-disciplinary art.It seems I was born with the ability to retell a picture or a story with very simple words.Later, at the age of 10.I could even turn these words into lyrics.When I was in junior high school.I often rewrote some English songs into Chinese songs and wrote lyrics for songs of different themes.After graduating from high school, I went to a specialized school and majored in graphic design.So I slowly applied this ability into photography and painting, and later even into 3D models.That is to say, I enjoy expressing my different life experiences with creative works.Here are some of the photos I took with film cameras.Artists may find it daunting to work with me.Because every time they do a sound recording, a MV, or an advertisement with me.I will invite them to be my models and take lots of photos of them no matter whether they are willing or reluctant.Which is beyond their proper job description.You can guess how they feel by the helpless look on their face.However, they cooperated for most of the time because they know that I really like taking pictures.There is also painting. Sketch is my favorite form of expression. These black and white pictures give me a sense of simplicity, softness, and emotional calmness.The pictures on the top are some my drawing. I have a habit, if I am on a two- or three-hour flight, I will draw one picture during the flight.I often draw on the magazines offered on the plane and I would finish the painting within two hours.However, the picture at the lower left of the screen is a fine depiction of Li Jiaxin.A very detailed sketch.These are detailed sketches, each of which takes for 100 hours to complete.I would spend two or three hours a day on these paintings. After work, I go home and draw for a few hours. It takes one to two months, or even half a year to complete such a painting.These textures, water, and hairs are drawn stroke by stroke.This process enables me to talk to myself and gives me more time to plan the overall picture.This is because arts work in a similar way. Many people have asked me in what ways different arts are similar.Next is the third part of the speech.Some of my frequently adopted means or techniques of creation.Some of the techniques that I use frequently are "unbalanced", "asymmetrical", "contrast", and "sublimation".The first technique is a simple one.Which refers to an unbalanced or asymmetrical visual design, in terms of the size or the position of objects.Take the picture on the upper right of the screen as an example.A cyclist is facing several thousands of passers-by.The asymmetry and imbalance of the layout.Another technique is "contrast", the contrast of color. The picture on the upper left of the screen is such an example.The picture on the right of the screen is another example. In this picture, Liang Yongqi is depicted in both black and white. There is also color contrast in the sketch on the lower left of the screen.I would also like to mention that there is a slogan on the soda can, which was created by me. It may difficult for you to see it. It reads, "love our earth like it's your heart".Let us look at the word "earth". If you move the last letter "H" to the front, it will read "heart". This is the slogan of my own creation.Another technique is sublimation.Many people say that art is a sublimation of life.What is sublimation?An important question that need to be asked here is whether you have the ability to see something extraordinary from something ordinary and common.Because I am very fond of modifying models.Remodeling something originally ordinary into something extraordinary.For example, I find the shape of Polaroid very interesting and I would imagine how to change it into something different.Therefore, I bought one, took it apart, repainted it, turned it into the shape of a spaceship, and added some very militarized parts to it. Then, I edited the picture and turned it into something like a poster.The most important thing is that, after all the alteration, it can still take pictures.It is still a normal Polaroid.This is also a kind of inspiration from life, a kind of sublimation.Here is a picture of a draft that I made before. I spent lots of time designing this draft. I have collected some parts and some models, but I have not had time to do it.I have always wanted to convert a mini car into a helicopter.I have a friend, who is a parent.He asked me one day."Shaoqi, you have so much interest and creations.In your view,how can I help my child to develop some literacies or interests that takes dedication?Then I asked him a question. I asked him whether he had encouraged his child to do something, some tasks or works, that take one month, half a year, or more than one year to complete in addition to buying the child the latest mobile phone, computer, or notebook.He looked at me with surprise and said no.Therefore, I asked him to do it right away.In a new era of new media and high technology.If you want your child to stay competitive and stand out.You should train him to do some works and tasks that take a long time to complete besides giving him a mobile phone and a notebook.Because there are fewer and fewer people who have such a capability.This is the first kind of sublimation in art that I told him.Next is about the second kind of sublimation. Nowadays there is too much information. We have access to tons of information, good or bad, relevant or irrelevant, every time we log on WeChat and Weibo.Therefore, my advice to him is to try to improve his judgment ability and aesthetic standards.What did I mean?That is to say, we should spend less time in criticizing some bad things and judging some people we do not know. On the contrary, we should spend more time in appreciating what we feel good and viewing the good works.This will make our own aesthetics standards more pure.The last point I want to share is to be diligent and to slow down life.There is a very popular phrase called "slow living".Many people mistake it as a very laid-back life. They think sitting in a coffee shop for three hours is slow living, but it is not in my definition.A slow living life can be also a diligent one.You have just saw lots of works that I have done. I have created many works.Pardon me if it sounds like I am bragging, I work hard even when I am enjoying a leisure activity.Because you cannot just waste hundreds of hours doing a painting or making a model. This is not about making money.I want to mention that in Hong Kong’s golden age of music.Most artists and composers were hardworking too, including the late Leslie Cheung and Anita Mei.I will not elaborate on it today. Because you probably have heard their stories.For example, Anita Mei used to work in an amusement park. At the age of seven or eight, she had to practice singing and dancing every day. That is why she can become a queen on the stage.This is my understanding of slow living.To show the imbalance and asymmetry with my life style in a contrast way.Why?I still listen to vinyl records very often until today, although it takes lots of time.You can have access to thousands of songs or tens of thousands of songs with the music app on your mobile phone. However, I still enjoy listening to vinyl, although it takes lots of time. The record has to be flipped every 15 minutes.I also love taking pictures with film cameras.And doing bicycle modification.Now it is very convenient to drive, but I still enjoy remodeling bicycles. I spend so much time looking for some parts from all around the world on the internet. It is not expensive, but it takes time.Through this process, I grow attached to all the things that I have.And more and more connected to them.In this era of new media, everything becomes outdated in an instant. Everything is easily obtained and forgotten.Therefore, through slow living, I learn to cherish what I can get.Recently I have been very interested into doing models of houses.I built a railway model at home.Because I want to build a model of a small city in Japan.It is very time-consuming. It takes a long time to build a model of a house.Therefore, when I was working with the new generation of artists and singers.I told them that diligence is necessary if they want to survive in this circle.In addition to packaging and your public image.You have to stay diligent if you want to stay popular.Because pop art and pop culture have developed for so many years.It is very difficult to create something new from scratch, be the new carriers, new compositions or new styling.Let alone being legendary, it is hard enough to stay popular.So if you want to stay popular, hard work is necessary.As a summary of today's speech.I want to tell you the story behind a song.This song is about Leslie Cheung.Because April is the season to be in memory of Leslie.In 1990, Leslie Cheung decided to leave the music industry.One night, several of us were eating at a restaurant in Central Hong Kong.He mentioned that he had an idea and wanted to retreat from the music industry.Then I told him that he established his fame with The Wind Continues to Blow. So maybe I could write another song with the theme of "wind". A song which would remind his fans of him every time they hear it.This song is When the Wind Blows Again.</seg>
<seg id=4>We can tell Apu's imperfection.We met each other back in 1984.I was then a college student and just graduated from Arts School.Apu was new to the Children's Palace to learn drawing.From then on, 34 years have passed.Apu has what we call moderate mental retardation.So far, Apu has created around 4100 works, 2000 of which are relevant to classic music.Now let's talk about Apu.When such a special kid came to the Children's Palace 34 years ago, it never came across me that 34 years later we would have such a thing called special education or inclusive education.Well, perhaps I was the first teacher who had to deal with children with special conditions.When Apu was born, he couldn't open his eyes and nor eat milk, his body was weak.Facing a baby like him, his parents really hoped that some divine power could come down and save them.In the picture down below, you can see me on the left side and Apu on the right side.There was the large painting.He painted with his tiny figure, waving his brushes.You could tell that he is really talented.20 years ago, when Apu published his first album, we founded an Art Experimental Class for Children With Special Needs.We recruited a dozen of children, some had cerebral palsy, some with autism or Down's Syndrome etc. They were kids with special needs.We taught these children on a voluntary basis, including Apu.It was our hope that through an example like Apu's, we could encourage children with special needs to express themselves through arts.Therefore, in 2006, when we finished the construction of the 2nd Children's Palace, we founded the Center of Special Education to provide specific services for these children.In 2010, we received the financial support from lottery institutions.From then on, every year we would provide 2000 non-profit tuition-free degrees to social candidates.So far we have provided altogether 15000 free degrees.We're grateful for the progress from just a dozen of children to around 2000 children with our degree.Thanks to Apu who had inspired us to help children like him, we have gone far to where we are now today.Currently we have opened over 60 art education courses and we could provide the door-to-door service.For instance, we could provide arts courses or music courses to children in hospital, such as the ward for cancer patients in a Guangzhou hospital, both regularly and irregularly.We also deliver art courses in welfare house.Our goal is that all children could play to their full strength.Every child is unique.We hope they could become the best version of themselves.In 2014, we founded our Inclusive Art Group.I'll play an introduction video so you can know our group better.Our children's palace has been working on special education for 20 years, now we witness a harmony between the kids, with or without a condition, they get along with each other very well.Every time when I see this picture and notice how they get along with each other so well, I feel happy from the bottom of my heart.Let us take a look.Over the last couple of days, I sorted out the video materials TV stations have shot for Apu.This one was made 30 years ago by Art Gallary Program of Guangdong TV station when Apu was just 10 years old.He was really into drawing.Back then he could still walk like all the others.And another video shot by Oriental Horizon Program of CCTV 20 years ago.Then he had shown severe mental retardation.He was then working on his album.His mother who was still very young, spoke of her concern with a lumpy throat and cried in tears.20 years have passed.Now Apu's mother is a grey-haired woman.She went through a knee surgery and has trouble walking, suffering from all sorts of ailments.Apu has had a hard life.For example, he has to wear catheter to urinate.So it causes a lot of inconvenience for him to go out.Every year he needs to go to the hospital to go through a bladder augmentation.Life is full of ups and downs.So his life is basically filled with drawing, medication and rehabilitation surgery, time after time.It is not convenient for him to go out, for the difficulty in hailing a taxi.For the parents whose child with walking issues, especially those with celebral palsy, they see their child growing up by days and themselves aging at the same time, it becomes more and more difficult for them to carry their child.The day will come when they couldn't do it anymore.At that time, a common experience for parents in difficulties is that even taxi drivers would ignore them.But what I'm trying to say is that we might experience what they have experienced.Why?Because we all will age one day and one day we will be seated in a wheelchair.My parents, one at the age of 80 and another at the age of 90.They have been sent to hospitals.As I watch them aging, I can feel that my body is aging as well.Sometimes I have trouble moving around or feel pain in my knees.I can't say for sure that I will never sit in a wheelchair.So maybe one day when I'm old, I will need to sit in a wheelchair just like Apu does or I might need mobility aids.So now we go back to our 20 years' efforts in education for children with special needs and inclusive education.What I really want to say is I feel immensely grateful for those children and their families, for their parents.It might seem that for the past 20 years, we have provided a lot to them, such as the number of degrees or the amount of resources, we provided opportunities to these children to speak up in front of the public and to show their presence and talents.But I believe it is these children that have given us the opportunities to rediscover our compassion towards people and to love people as we love ourselves.It seems that we are helping them, but in fact, we are also helping ourselves.None of us can say for sure that we won't end up holding a cane or sitting in a wheelchair.I'm dedicated to inclusive education simply because one day when I get old, when I call a taxi sitting in a wheelchair, the taxi driver wouldn't choose to ignore me.I would like to wrap up the speech with two lines I wrote a long time ago.To sugar baby, whose name I still don't know, it is so good to see you.That day, the tiny and soft you ran towards me, hugged and kissed me.The sudden trust and love, as if a beam of warm sunshine, cleared away all the pain or sadness inside my heart.At that very moment, you were so strong that you could save and complete the world that lacked love.According to the so-called social standards, people would think of you as a defected or even useless person.It is good to have you, children of the Art Group.One day in a crowd, I saw one secretary of our art group pushing around his friend in a wheelchair and we passed each other.That beautiful scenario was forever engraved in my mind.We're here today mainly for one purpose, to discuss one concern, the concern of Apu's mother's for herself, for Apu, or our shared concern for one day ending up in the wheelchair when we get older.But now the concern will no longer exist.Because we will love others the same way we love ourselves.When people warm and protect each other, when people love each other, will it be long before we form a united community of destiny?Because with each other's love, there will be no worries nor fear.I believe this is the most important significance of inclusive education.Thank you all!</seg>
<seg id=5>Hello, everyone.My name is Wu Zhengdan, the creator of the “ballet on the shoulder”.From 6 to 16, I am an athlete.This period should have been the happiest moment in my childhood.But that’s for other children, not for me.When I was 6 years old, I only did the most basic thing, which is enduring pains every day.However, this has laid a great foundation for me.I have a very good physical state and quality, as well as an excellent elasticity.These qualities are essential for me becoming a dancer like myself today.For some reasons, I was eliminated and sent the team of acrobatic gymnastics, which is still a sport.When I was 6, I met my partner.At that time, we didn't know that we would be a pair and now he is my husband.By coincidence, we were arranged by the coach to become partners, for the mixed pair program in acrobatic gymnastics.I was so afraid that he might bully me or even beat me.When I first met him, I told him that I would not practice with him unless he agreed to three rules: first, he was not allowed to beat me; second, he was not allowed to shout at me; third, he was not allowed to drop me.Why did I mention being dropped?Because some acrobatic movements are performed high above the ground.I will be lifted up into the air.If the base performer is not happy, the one on the top may be dropped.He accepted my conditions and kept his promise.We worked together as a mixed pair since 1992.He is still my partner, and also my life partner.During a competition in 1996, when I performed somersault on his shoulder, I slipped, fell and hit my head on the floor.I nearly repeated Sang Lan’s accident.Nevertheless, the accident became a turning point.It was my great honor that our performance impressed leaders of Soldier Acrobatic Troupe of the Political Department of Guangzhou Military Region.They invited us to Guangzhou where I started a new career.I had never thought of becoming an acrobat.When I came to the Soldier Acrobatic Troupe, I didn’t have a clue about my future.During the troupe's global tour, we performed only the acrobatic mixed pair program.With a slight recasting of a previous work, it was showed to the foreign audience.A very famous ballet master, who was also the Artistic Director of the Royal Danish Ballet, watched our performance.He commended that, “These two performers were so beautiful that they danced like the prince and princess of ballet.”His comments inspired me.I began to wonder if I could wear a pair of pointe shoes.So, I wore the shoes and started the first step -- standing on the floor and rising up on my toes.However, standing on the tips of my toes was barely enough.By no means could I dance as well as professional ballerinas.After all, they started the ballet training when they were 10.At that time, I was already 20 years old.When we composed “ballet on the shoulder”, I did not know where I could stand.I found the best spot gradually, by stepping on the body of my partner, my husband.I left my footprints on almost every inch of his skin.He just laid on the ground and let me step anywhere I wanted.It was a painful journey.We wanted to combine acrobatics with ballet, but how?The only choice is through the body, by standing on his body.But we had no idea where I could stand.We had to try, finding the largest area of his body.Our first option was the back of my partner.But that didn't seem exquisite enough, so how did we do?I decided to stand on the shoulder.But on which part of the shoulder?Standing here, or there?After thousands of experiments, we believed only this part of muscle was large enough to stand without touching his bone.So, we finally decided to try this part of shoulder.But this place, as you can see from the picture, was so difficult to stand that I would surely fall off if missing only one millimeter.Every day, I failed and tried again.Why do I show this picture?This is the shoulder of my husband.Every day it was seriously bruised, because I had to spin and turn around repeatedly with toes on his shoulder, constantly producing frictions.The top of my pointe shoes was covered with blood and pus.In Guangdong where the weather was remarkably hot, the day after I finished practicing, a thin layer of scab formed on my husband’s shoulder.But the scab would be soon screwed off by my first ballet movement on the second day.But we kept working on it day after day for hundreds, if not thousands, of times.Why was that?The physical pain was no big deal for me.Because physical injuries were common among actors and athletes. We were able to bear the pain.Even if I broke my feet, I could perform immediately after the nerve block injection.What we feared most was the feeling of loss and confusion.Why?Because we did not have any directions.No coach could tell me whether I was doing good or wrong.I didn't know the skills nor technical requirements.I didn’t have any ready solution to the problems.I did not know what made my movement good or what was wrong with my bad movement.Every day we were immersed in confusion.Although we were already in a relationship, we almost broke up for this work.Every day, we argued, disagreed, quarreled and complained to each other.Success was something we all desired, but we did not know where to head for.We were not sure of how the work was going to be like.During our preparation, everyone would confronted us with, “Are you going to disgrace ballet? Are you going to subvert ballet?”We really didn’t know what would happen.That was the scariest thing during that period.Now, I feel so lucky that we stick to it.No matter what difficulties we met, the one that paused the work or the one made me nearly quit, we persevered and finally made it.Later, we also tried ballet on the head.We toured in many countries for performance.I had imagined the success, but I never thought of such a huge recognition and acknowledgement.As a Chinese performer, with the current context, my performance has attracted people from different places around the world, I felt very proud as a Chinese performer.I created the choreography in 1998 and won the prize in 2002.During the four years in Guangzhou, we had no friends.I came here with my husband, from Liaoning Province, the northeastern part of China, and we practiced for 10 hours a day in the rehearsal room.In retrospect, I think it was a very hard time, but I am very proud for my perseverance.I am very very lucky, because not everyone attains success with hard work, but I won the recognition.Besides, I have done something that I am good at.I have all the favorable conditions to show my talents, my values and advantages.I have great passion for my job.It has become a hobby of mine and I enjoy it.I am nearly 40 years old, but I am still on the stage.Sometimes, I feel a little bit tired, but this kind of tiredness is bittersweet to me.I enjoy the work I am doing.Thank you!This is the feedback from some of our audience during our performance.We participated in 30 consecutive performances at the Shanghai Grand Theatre.Few programs in China could achieve this -- we received standing ovations for every performance.I will tell you the truth.Every time before I entered the stage or standing on the stage, I was so tired and overwhelmed by the non-stop work, that I hoped the stage lights could go out.I hoped that the stage was out of light for a whole day or some accident occurred, so that I could stop performing.I had such illusion.But when I stood on the stage and started to perform.I was still dedicated until the last minute.After the 1.5 hours show, when I took a bow to the applauding audience, I thought it was all worthwhile.I really enjoyed the moment when I was met by standing ovations.At the moment, all the tiredness disappeared in an instance.That was the happiest time of my life as a performer.Up until now, I am still passionate about the stage and the peak of my career lasted until 2008.I fell from the peak of my career because of an accident, my pregnancy.It should be a good thing.But for a performer, especially when I was at the peak of my dancing career, I was not prepared to be a mom.After giving birth, my body was out of shape.All my trainings in past were in vain.I was not able to stand on the stage as perfectly as before.Getting back in shape was hard for me. I still remembered the hardships as if they happened yesterday.Even though it was 37 Celsius Degree in Guangzhou, wrapped in plastic wrap and putting on clothes for weight loss, I spent one hour on running every afternoon.I ate food on a scale.No matter how many dishes were on the table, I only had five bites of food and walked away.Because only in this way could I lose weight rapidly.My love for the job, at that time, turned into obsession.Why was I so eager to recover my body shape?Because I found myself falling in to a state of depression.Because I truly felt that in the past 20 years, I only did one thing, that was performing on the stage.I found that I was not good at any other things.Only by performing could I show my value.Therefore, I really hoped to get back on the stage as soon as possible.My waist, my entire lumbar spine, was not as flexible as before.But there is a benefit of taking a long break.I found that sometimes in life, you will become better, but not necessarily onstage.The one year’s break gave me another reward.My life and stage experience were refreshed.I had different feelings.When I expressed myself through dance, the emotions, ideas and the message I conveyed to the audience were totally different.People told me, “Zhengdan, you have elevated to a new level. You have made progress again.”So, I think a person at different periods in his life will gain different things and go through different feelings.I find that skills could improve naturally after a certain age, but you have to wait until it comes.This is my experience.Then I got back to the stage and won the Galina Ulanova Prize in Russia.This reward is very precious to every dancer.I am an acrobatic performer or more precisely, a crossover ballet dancer.I am very proud that I can receive the honor and I really cherish it.Now I am not only a performer, but also a keeper and a torch-passer of the art.My responsibility and obligation are to pass “ballet on the shoulder”, the miracle and technique created by the Chinese, to the next generation, so that the art is kept alive.Besides, I have trained many little friends.I hope their dream could come true and I am ready to give a hand.I also believe, dance learners are the most dedicated and hardworking people.They will succeed in everything they do.To summarize, the perfection that we will never reach but never give up pursuing is the charm of ballet.“Ballet on the shoulder” occupies the first half of my life and I am grateful for this amazing encounter.Standing on the stage, on the shoulder of my husband, makes me feel very proud.At that moment, I feel very powerful and all-conquering.Thank you!</seg>
<seg id=6>Good afternoon, everyone.I am Zhang Wuxiong from the Shanghai Institute of Microsystems, Chinese Academy of Sciences.I will talk about how information technology represented by the Internet of Things can help engineering safety.I want to show it from several aspects.All of us hate the jerry-built project, but it is still inevitable at this stage.We can recall that in 2007, the Jiujiang Bridge collapsed in an instant because of the impact of the ship.This was also a very important event at that time.There are also many jerry-built expressway.We can look at the online assessment, which is the highway in Tianding, Gansu.After opening to traffic in 2011, although its construction cost was as high as 100 million yuan per kilometer.The highway was cracked within a few days after its completion, and then it couldn't be used immediately and entered maintenance period.There was also an incident in Shanghai.At that time, there was a similar incident on the banks of the Lotus River.Because of the extrusion of the soil, the building collapsed instantly.Of course, later, the price of this second-hand house is not too low.Because people later discovered that the glass and structure of this building was still very good.Just its foundation was not done well, but it cannot be denied that there have been cheating on workmanship and materials.In fact, from the perspective of Internet of Things.It can start from the beginning of a building's construction, to its operation and maintenance to do the safety protection for it as a whole.First let's see what is the Internet of Things.The term "Internet of Things" was picked by Premier Wen Jiabao during his visit to the Wuxi sub-center of our laboratory in 2009.We provided him with the architecture map.Now we all know the word IoT.Although the term Internet of Things may be unfamiliar to you, but we can have a look at it, there are many things in life that are already under the Internet of Things.We can look at the Mobike bicycles and OFO bicycles, which are good IoT applications.Nowadays, the best application of the IoT is smart driving or cars like this.Each car has hundreds of different sensors in this network to monitor the quality and operating status of the car.The following is co-pole that Shanghai is now implementing.It integrates utility poles and streetlights into a system.We can apply charging piles and WIFI to it, and then we can use it to do some of the environment monitoring.This is also a good application of the Internet of Things.We can review some of the early IoT applications, I will start from the right.This is the cyanobacteria monitoring we did in Taihu Lake in 2009, when the water quality in the Taihu Lake Basin was very bad.The security system of the World Expo next was also a large single IoT system at that time.We can look at this on the left.This is the Internet of Things system we have done for Pudong Airport.It has been working normally since 2006, for more than ten years.And we have already caught more than a dozen people who are going to do some damage, but they haven't got the chance to.The main reason is that we have this kind of Internet of Things system to carry out some early monitoring, to prevent and catch the destroyers in advance.Back to today's topic, how do we use the Internet of Things to help building safety?Let us first look at the construction safety of the building.What can the Internet of Things do?There are several important things in the construction of buildings.First, how can we ensure that qualified people are doing what they can do reasonably.On the other hand, we need to ensure that materials, processes, and safeguards are up to standard.We can look at the first construction site here, there are some IoT systems in it, we can monitor the management staff in real time to see whether they are at work.There is an electrician.Is he really an electrician who is operating some energized equipment?Does the one operating the tower crane has corresponding certificate?Correspondingly there are some systems that can do root-seeking, and some techniques that can be used for positioning.Then, whether the electricity is qualified for the building materials.We can also start from the moment the materials arrive at the site, test the, and put them in the designated position after the test.When someone goes to move these building materials, the system can maintain a trace of the entire process from its inbound to outbound.Just like we do food traceability.The third is that we have to ensure that the construction process is up to standard.We will have some means of IoT, sensor means, including some of our video surveillance methods to detect whether it is up to standard.In addition, we can look at whether the construction safety precautions are in place, whether our scaffolding is safe and reliable.And we will also use some sensors to monitor its quality.So on this basis, we have made a whole set of solutions or systems based on the Internet of Things.We can see that there are all kinds of such sensors underneath.We can manage people and tower cranes, hooks and elevators.We also manage the environment, including the exhaust and drainage inside, videos, as well as the vehicle's access, including its weighing and some automatic detection.With these sensors, we control all the conditions of the whole construction site through information.After that, we built a variety of application systems to conduct security monitoring and analysis.Here are some examples.First of all, on the left, when we have some security incidents, I want to make sure that my staff, my equipment and my rescue measures are all in their positions.In this case, there is also a system that can be used to monitor.The safety of the tower crane is also a very important system.We have some sensors on the tower crane to detect whether it is tilted, whether it is swinging, etc.So for environmental construction and monitoring, the current government requirements are very strict.We have to ensure that the water in the atmosphere is not polluted, so this is a very important part of the Internet of Things to solve construction safety.The glass curtain wall is a big problem we are considering.Our country has been building large-scale glass curtain walls since the 1980s.The high-rise buildings in our city are also very dense.Our glass curtain wall has reached 85% of the world's total, a very high proportion.However, the glass curtain wall also has a problem.Although the glass curtain wall has many advantages, it is more beautiful, and the construction is relatively simple.However, the life of the glass is only 15 years.If it is used normally, the structural adhesive of the glass is only about ten years.So no matter Glass breakage or structural adhesive failure will have a great impact on it.As for the field of glass curtain wall monitoring.It is unfortunate that because the world's largest glass curtain wall use country is China, foreign research in this field is not so advanced.Therefore, at present, the most traditional detection may be that we take some of the detected devices there on our back and detect them one by one.There are also some detection methods, that is, using this rubber hammer to knock and listen to the sound of the glass, so it is relatively primitive and backward.At the same time we have some building materials whose life, mainly glass.Including structural glue and some structural parts inside, is relatively short, unlike our concrete structure.The third one is that the external atmospheric factors are also relatively large.The typhoon has a great influence on the bridge, and it is the same for the glass.It hits constantly.At the same time, the glass is cleaned every year.When the outer wall is rubbed, the tower crane hung the platform down.When the wind blows, it will sway and hit the glass, which brings a lot of safety problems.In the past few years, the Shanghai Center also had a similar incident.A piece of glass fell.Luckily it hit a car, not a person.Think of an egg that falls on dozens of floors could kill people, not to mention a glass.Therefore, we use the technology and means of the Internet of Things to do a glass curtain wall safety monitoring system, which is cooperated with some schools such as Jiaotong University and Tongji.We have front-end sensors to detect vibration, stress, strain, including temperature and other parameters that affect glass safety.There are also some narrow-band IoT transmission technologies that make it easy to collect state data from the front-end glass.After the data collection comes up, we can combine it with the big data and cloud computing tools in the platform.Including the more fashionable artificial intelligence.We conducted a large amount of data collection and analysis.And were able to provide early warning and establish a model in which the glass curtain wall would be broken.In this way, we can know the extent of this risk.The second question is whether we could get to the glass curtain wall in the thunderstorm day?In fact, according to our current safety standards, glass has certain safety, but with our system, I believe that in the future it will be much safer.So going back to the third question is how we can solve the security of the Internet of Things in the process of running.The picture on the left is the Jinmao Building.When we think of the safety of this building, we may first think of high-rise buildings.In fact, some places that are dangerous now are small and micro-locations, including group renting houses.There are so many people living in the family workshops, and the hidden dangers of water and electricity and fire protection are also very large.Just like our current theater, if there is a fire next to it, maybe everyone has already withdrawn, but we don’t know if it’s a fire next door.It may have been very late when it burns over.Are there any means and measures that can  solve the problems or give us some tips?There are.So we thought a lot of ways in the process of running, and we have done a lot of IoT systems for many different applications.This is an independent smoke sensor, which is popular at present.The traditional smoke sensor may be linked by the fire station, connecting with the sprinkler facility.Any building must have this equipment if it is to be accepted.But now there are some independent smoke sensor, which can integrate some technologies into it, such as NB-IoT, LoRa and so on.Because of these narrow-band transmission technologies, for example, it can have a life of more than ten years, so after we put this in the room, we can integrate some voice broadcast information on it.If it is on fire next door, we may have this room informed at once.With the support of the Shanghai Economic and Information Committee and the Science and Technology Commission.We have distributed nearly 30,000 independent smoke sensors in Yangpu and Hongkou and the Oriental Pearl.In each family in the future, if you are interested, you can also buy this kind of equipment and install it at home.You can see whether your home has a fire or a hidden danger through the APP.The safety of the elevator is also a big problem.Shanghai is actually a place where elevators are very widely used.We have 300,000 sets of elevators, and there may be thousands of elevators that have been in service for more than 15 years.There are also 70,000-8,0000 units in 10 to 15 years, so this is also a huge amount.The actual service life of the elevator is generally only ten years according to requirements, so how to maintain it is also a big problem.Although we did not have so many accidents, the Internet of Things will certainly do a lot of work for the safety of elevators.So now we have a lot of sensors in the elevator, for floors, leveling, smoke sensor, main wire current and temperature, to judge whether the elevator is safe.After doing this, we collect the elevator status data and can do a lot of artificial intelligence analysis remotely.After that, we can rationally maintain the elevator.Now the normal maintenance of the elevator may be carried out with paper materials by people.Did he go there?How is the maintenance?No one knows.But in the future, with this IoT system, we can guarantee the safety of each elevator for real.This is actually not my profession.We have some fresh air in this building, including some systems for water supply and drainage.With some technical means of the Internet of Things.We can check the wind at the outlet of the fresh air through the sensor, check the air quality, temperature and humidity in the room to adjust them to the most suitable level.Then in the water supply and drainage, we can check whether the water volume, flow rate is appropriate, and then whether there is some pollution, etc..In this way, we can guarantee the safety of the whole building.This is what our partner did on Guangzhou Tower.Like the tall building of this kind, after we put some sensors on it, we can also check the swing and vibration of this tall building to judge whether it is in a safe state.This is what I think will be used in the high-rise buildings like the Shanghai Center in the future.Then another piece, this piece is my own work for seven or eight years.We did a security system for the middle line of the South-to-North Water Transfer Project.The middle line is 1432 kilometers from the Danjiangkou Reservoir at the junction of Hubei and Henan to Beijing and Tianjin, with 1 billion cubic meters of water per year.But there were a lot of problems.We can have a look at it, It will drill a tunnel every time it meets a mountain, and build a bridge evey time it comes across a valley.It was very complicated.Then there are indeed a lot of safety problems inside.Like the aqueduct above, it is two kilometers long and full of water.The pressure of thousands of tons of water on the whole base is also very large.So we have a variety of sensors on it to monitor its displacement and seepage, and then build the engineering safety monitoring system accordingly.At the same time, we combine some weather information with the outside, no matter it is the information of the Meteorological Bureau or the information of the local rainfall station.At the same time, we also did monitoring the amount of water and water quality.Gather the information together to protect the entire project safety of the South-to-North Water Transfer Project.We have also built a system to prevent human invasion.If someone climbs the fence and enters the channel, I will know it and find him out in advance.This will also improve the safety of the project.Here is an example.Just like this kind of human invasion is also a big hidden danger.Because we digged the project artificiallys, it is very difficult for people who fall into this channel to get out.The slope is made of cement, which is very difficult to climb up.Therefore, human security is also a very core issue in the South-North Water Transfer Project.I just talked about some technical means of various Internet of Things to solve or guarantee the safety of buildings.Whether it is a bridge or a building, whether it is a highway or project of South-to-North Water Transfer.The new sensor of the future is indeed a very core technology, and maybe some implementation can be done in the future.In our future intelligent buildings, it is necessary to informatize the entire process of building construction, including operation, renewal, and maintenance to the future.On the one hand, it enhances the safety level of this building, on the other hand, it also provides some convenience for people's lives.But our country still has a lot of defects in the new sensor.We need a variety of new sensors on the one hand, but we can also see that especially in the high-end smart sensors.The United States, Japan and Germany are more advanced, accounting for about 70% of the world, and our country is only about 10%. .From a production point of view, there are more than 20,000 sensors in our country, and there are only about 10,000 in our country.So this is also a big shortcoming for us, but where are the benefits?It is the sensor industry in our country.From the original counterfeiting, it has gradually begun to expand to the high end.Some chip factories in our country have begun to embark on the high-end route.Here are some examples.Some of our high-speed accelerometers, including gyroscopes, used to be widely used in the military industry and are now turning to civilians.Some of our pressure sensors are now also used in water meters and gas meters.Some of our explosion-proof sensors, which we have already used when doing this security check at Pudong Airport.Some of our equipment with millimeter waves, including some of the security equipment, are already in use at the airport.So I believe that in the next three to five years, many of our high-end sensors can achieve breakthroughs.With these sensors, we can provide more powerful technologies and means for building safety, especially for future assembled buildings, to protect its safety.Thank you!</seg>
<seg id=7>Hello, everyone.I'm Lin Pin, an observer as well as a follower of the ACG(Anime, Comic and Games) culture.I believe everybody here have heard more or less about the concept of ACG culture.However, not everybody knows the origion of ACG culture or the reason why it is prevalent.If we trace back, we would find out that the term actually came from Japanese.It was originally a geometric term that referred to two-dimensional space and world in the Japanese.The buzzword ACG or the two-dimensional space that we are gonna discuss today did not form its meaning and usage until the mid-1990s.In my view, "the root of all evil" can be traced back to the debut of the animation Martian Successor Nadesico in 1996.This is a science-fiction anime that sets the context at the end of the 22nd century.It depicts a group of particularly interesting characters.They are descendants of human migrants that was exiled to the Jupiter by the civilization on earth in the 21st century, which is ages ago according to the plot.Before they were exiled to Jupiter, their ancestors carried along with them an anime called Gekiganger III. Over time, the book Gekiganger III became a special existence for the civilization on Jupiter.Because not only the people on Jupiter warship the book of Gekiganger III and take the spirits of it as their life moto.They are also crazy about the heroin, Nanako, and regard her as their goddess.However, people on Jupiter could never achieve their dream of meeting Nanako, why is that?Because they are people in two separate worlds just like us standing outside the screen and the people on Jupiter who are inside the screen.In the ainime, the people on Jupiter are the audience and Nanako is the character of the show, they are located in two completely separate worlds.You may have noticed that the limitation is insurmountable physically and physiologically as such. In face of such situation, the people on Jupiter find themselves in complete hopelessness and could only console each other by saying that."Nanako is perfect, but nevertheless she is in the two-dimensional world."I wonder if you could relate to this line.But for me, I was deeply touched when I first read it.It also echoed with many Japanese anime and game lovers called "Otaku" when later presented in Japan.Now think about it, we may all have fallen in love deeply with some anime, cartoon and game characters.However, it's never possible for us to make physical contact or physiological connection with these characters.Becasuse these characters that we love so much exist only in a virtual world consists of two-dimensional lines, planar images and motion pictures.The line is so enlightening and the concept of ACG culture it conveys showed us the dimensional difference between two group of people clearly and precisely, which highlights the character of it as an intermediary.Since the mid-1990s, an increasing number of game enthusiasts began to use the abbreviation of ACG culture to refer the two-dimensional virtual world created with anime, cartoon and games.Here I'd like to point out that, when people on Jupiter and anime and game lovers adopt the concept of ACG, they seem to differentiate it from the three-dimensional concept. That is, they tend to separate the virtual 2D world from the 3D real world in which real people live.At first sight, this seem to form a contrast between the reality and virtual world.But when you think closely of the context of the sentence uttered by the person on Jupiter.He actually expressed earnestly his genuine and strong affection towards the 2D world and characters.It is this affection that arouses the dedicated longing for actual contact with Nanako.As well as the pious practice of the Gekiganger spirits in life.According to my observation and personal experience of ACG culture.It is easy to notice that many anime and game lovers could get sincere emotional experience from the 2D world in a sense of psychological realtiy rather than the physical reality.Moreover, compared with the 3D society requiring certain masks to comply in appearance.Their emotional commitment to the 2D world may be more sincere and intense.Thus, we cannot judge or differentiate the relationship between true and false, real and virtual in a logical frame for binary opposition.Perhaps the question that is worth asking is that.Why do so many people commit so sincerely and strongly to the object referred to as the virtual world and characters?Here I'd like to introduce an academic and theoretical term to support the explanation and interpretation of such a socio-cultural trend.During my undergraduate studies, there was once an experienced predecessor or senior who enlightened me by saying that post-modernity was like a basket that could accommodate everything.Here I'd like to first share with you the theoretical concept of post-modernity which usually leads to intense discussion.The application of it varies from person to person, and different people may fill in distinct theoretical connotations.Then in what specific sense am I sharing the concept of post-modernity with you?Well, I borrow the usage from a Japanese expert in otaku culture, named Hiroki Azuma, who is the fat guy behind me on the right.Or the concept of Lyotard, a French post-modernist and philosopher that Hiroki Azuma quoted.According to them, the status of post-modernity first implies the decline of grand narratives.What is grand narrative then?Here it refers to a series of systems of concepts that modern political communities base on to unite their members since the Enlightenment.It provides an authoritative interpretation for the rules of social functions.Transcendental value and significance for human activities, as well as a coherent narrative for the development process of our history.During the historical changes of the 20th century.However, certain grand narratives supporting the modern civilization are gradually deprived of their authority and appeal.While during the turbulent years from the outbreak of the World War I to the end of the Cold War, tragic and traumatic historical events one after another almost destroy the tower of faith in humanism, enlightenment and reason, as well as the notion of historical progress.The update of liberal capitalism and modern science and technology dispels the social foundation of some grand narratives to a great extent and renders the whole society highly mobile and scattered.As the modern grand narrative collapses in the context of post-modern, as the new generation growing from its ruins.We are facing a vacuum field of cultural value.As like those people on Jupiter in Martian Successor Nadesico, their spiritual connection with the civilization on earth is cut off when they were banished to Jupiter.For us, the new generation who is involved and evolve in the context of post-modernity, it's also difficult to connect our inner world to the grand narrative which the modern civilization once tried to construct in a rational, smooth and convincing way.It is in such a context that the ACG culture plays an important role and exerts great mental influence on us.In the ACG culture, a great many of excellent 2D works would provide a grand system for world view setting while narrating a intriguing story, in the same way as Gekiganger III did to fill the vacuum of spirit, culture and value for those Jupiter people.These world view systems accommodate people in ruins of grand narratives in a distinct and characteristic manner with grand narrative alternatives, also referred to as 2D grand narratives.The ACG enthusiasts, without doubt, are diverse in constitution as well as in form, whereas from my personal experience. The most attractive part of the ACG is no other than the compensating mental effects realized by these two-dimensional grand narratives.In my childhood, I used to buy Dragon Ball or YuYu Hakusho that selled for 0.5 yuan each.Later I watched Naruto and Digimon on the television and desktop.In my youth, I liked to watch Fate and Madoka Magica on my tablet, laptop and smartphone.These ACG works I love and indulge in deeply always break the boundaries between tradition and modernity, the east and the west, the mundane and mysterious, as well as science and magic.Which blends a variety of elements into a grand system that builds people's world view.Thanks to the ACG culture, technology is no longer dull and cold, and seems to become dynamic and magical.At the same time, magic doesn't make up evocation of pre-modern spirits, and instead, it becomes an enchanting source of wonders by means of emergent media.Such setting of world views enables us to be immersed in such characters as we'll probably identify with them and imagine that we possess supernatural power.We would have magical experience in a magnificent and witty space.Moreover, new intermediaries like the anime and games would make these wonderful experiences more drastic and impressive.As such, they constitute a pleasure reactor, one with strong power offering the cartoon readers, animation audience and game players ceaseless pleasure.What's more to me is that these fantastic encounters under the 2D world view setting are usually endowed with significance linking the fate of a community and even the world as the story unfolds.Meanwhile, characters are placed under relatively extreme circumstances to set off the emotional energy contained in the bond among characters.The bond here is a two-dimensional term representing the strong and profound emotional connection between people.For me, there's a narrative pattern that is quite common yet always feasible.As worldwide crisis keeps escalating, bonds among characters are constantly threatened and tested with issues of life and death.To sustain the fragile and necessary bond under extreme circumstances among the characters that we identify with.The causal links must be transformed to a potential activating key to release energy of the inner universe, so as to save the external universe and defend the bond simultaneously.Why can such a narrative pattern hit me repeatedly?As far as I can see, the potential emotional intensity of such a bond will be extremely difficult for post-modern 2D enthusiasts to experience in the mediocre and mechanically repeating 3D life, provided that audio-visual media can successfully create a sense of immersion and the animation audience, cartoon readers and game players can be sincerely immersed in it.Furthermore, the world view setting and the plots design of 2D works can thus render the transcending value and expression long lost for me at least temporarily self-justified within the story framework and structure of feeling.When I see Sun Wukong, here I'd like to call him Kakarotto based on the principle of "drama is not nonsense.And adaptation is not made up" -- when I see Kakarotto transcend his own limits continuously to defend his important partners and the Earth.When I see Naruto Uzumaki ceaselessly stand sufferings and tests hard to imagine for ordinary people to realize a world of great harmony where people understand each other.When I see the King of Knights, Saber, wield the sword Excalibur and destroy the evil Holy Grail at the price of his own life and say farewell to his love of life.When I see Madoka Kaname sacrifice his own life and traces of existence to reverse the causation of the whole universe and bring final hope to each and every magical girl dying in despair.The excitement and sacred feeling I feel is impossible to experience in the three-dimensional society pervaded by the atmosphere of nihilism, cynicism, refined egoism and extreme individualism.For me, the 2D grand narrative in this sense may have a spiritual compensation effect on many 2D enthusiasts.We often hear severe criticism from seniors towards the ACG culture followers.Criticism like, "You are escaping from reality."Or, "You're addicted to the virtual world."In my opinion, or when we observe and comprehend from another perspective.However, if modern grand narratives no longer have the meaning and value of truth for us.If we are inevitably situated in ruins of reality.Can we take the enthusiasm for ACG as a compensating spiritual pursuit as well?Or rather, as an immersive experience of a hyperreal world more real than the reality?Many friends here may think that the person is such a chuunibyo for my previous utterance, especially the four examples above.Well, as an experienced and well-informed 2D enthusiast.I'm often identified, recognized or teased as "a chuunibyo patient" by three-dimensional friends.But you're assured that a chuunibyo sufferer as me is in fact only one type of the 2D enthusiasts in all kinds of ACG culture followers, I am perhaps an old-fashioned one.What I'm gonna talk now may arouse more concern for many three-dimensional people.Because we can observe that since the 1990s, and not just in the post-cold war era, a cynic mood has spread across the globe.And in the specific social context of Japan, ordinary Japanese even ran up against the burst of bubble economy and secular stagnation, known to history as "Heisei Depression".Young people growing from this period of depression are inevitably lost in the grave nihility and a strong sense of powerlessness in face of the reality of consolidated social hierarchy and the fate of impossible interactions between individual struggle and the formation of history.And furthermore, the lost and decadent young people, like the protagonist Shinji Ikari in the Neon Genesis Evangelion, live in a post-industrial consumer society.They are well exposed to highly advanced cultural and creative industries that produce in a massive and differentiated manner all kinds of cultural products, thus get some pleasure and consolation from them.In such a background, a lot of "otaku" or self-teasing "Heisei dispirited otaku" appeared.In words of Hiroki Azuma, this is a generation emerging from the condition of more thorough post modernity that does not require grand narratives at all.So here comes the question, which brand has the best excavating technology?Zone 11 NERV Ikari Gendou!EVA excavator, you deserve it.Sorry, truly sorry, my chuunibyo breaks out again. That was not my actual question.My real question is what drives these otaku in consuming the ACG if they don't need two-dimensional grand narrative?According to Hiroki Azuma, it's neither the superficial story, nor the underlying world view setting that truly drives the cultural consumption, rather.It's the 2D characters that are present in the story and able to be extracted from the story context at the same time. It is the database of "cute Mo E"(adorable elements) that keeps updating and producing these characters.Before explaining the new concept of database of cute Mo E, it's necessary to review a very important business mode of the 2D industry.That is, IP operation, you've probably all heard about it, or it is often referred as MediaMix planning in Japan.For example, after the cartoon Attack on Titan gained high popularity.Animation and games adapted from it and a series of peripheral derivatives were quickly launched.After the cartoon Neon Genesis Evangelion became popular.Animation and games adapted from it and a series of peripheral derivatives were quickly produced.Same with the cartoon Steins;Gate. After it went viral, there were a serie of cartoon and game adaptations of it as well as deriviatives.The ACG culture could not only generate products of multiple intermediaries, but also develop product lines based one multiple media vehicles. Followers of the culture could also reuse the existing works as a material library and produce new contents themselves.For instance, fictions, cartoons, videos, radio plays, games, cosplay, peripheral products, handicrafts and the like based on the characters or settings in ACG works.So here's the question, we can imagine that during the IP operation and the derivation of "Doujinshi", the plot actually develops continuously.Even the world view setting is not persistent, and instead, various parallel universes are derived or produced.Then what pushes the 2D users to wander in the sea of contents constituted by both the IP product chains and the fan culture of doujinshi.From the current situation, the most probable answer is not 2D grand narratives on which chuunibyo followers like me would be keen. Rather, it's the 2D characters that attract 2D users so much as Nanako is to the Jupiter people.What I'd like to emphasize here is that, these 2D characters can actually surpass the context of stories and disengage from the world view setting for independent existence.And thus, for pop products like Hatsune Miku and Love Live.Design of only one or one group of 2D characters as fictitious idols is enough to support a product chain involving multiple media vehicles.Then what is it that maintains a relative consistencey among different 2D characters when they appear in different forms and keep switching from one universe from another set by different world views.It is the special combination of a fixed and non-narrative character profiles and the special characters.Or in words of Hiroki Azuma, the combination of "cute Mo E" and certain characters."Cute Mo E" here refers to the character setting elements that could evoke the affection of 2D users.In the highly sophisticated logic of the culture industry.The character setting elements of those 2D characters that gain users' affection to a certain extent will be analyzed and concluded to a "cute Mo E" database available for expansion of the industry and reproduction.The needs of both practitioners of the 2D industry and creators of the user-generated contents could be met in the vast "cute Mo E" database.Moreover, various "cute Mo E" characters can be created through separation, recombination and recirculation of these elements.This may be way too abstract, so let's look at an example.Behind me are there three 2D cute Mo E characters who are relatively popular.On my right and your left, is one of the heroins in the milestone animation Neon Genesis Evangelion that was first broadcast in 1995.Asuka, and she is a fierce girl with two pony tails, a classic character combined with cute Mo E elements.When the character setting of a fierce girl with two pony tails is proved to be a quite popular cute Mo E element combination by the market, it is quickly and widely adopted in the 2D industry.But attention please, adoption does not mean repetition.And instead, it means the creation of new cute Mo E characters during recombination. For instance, for one of the heroins in Fate, Rin Tohsaka (in the middle), and the important character Phyllis meow meow in Steins.Gate (on your right), all these character show the attribute of a girl with a strong personality and two pony tails.However, these new characters have some elements that Asuka does not have and these new combinations formed some new cute Mo E characters.Or we can look at Sun shangxiang in the Honor of Kings.Actually the character has nothing to with the Wu princess in the history.With the name of a Wu princess, she has two pony tails, a strong personality, a classic combination of cute Mo E elements.At the same time, the game designers also refer to some historical legends and pop culture to make Sun Shangxiang as someone that masters bows and arrows.And hence, she would definitely be an Archer if she were in Fate.Then with reference to such a setting, Sun Shangxiang is added, assembled and combined with an attribute of being good at weapons by holding long-range artillery in addition to a girl with two pony tails.You may find that this combination can only be established within such a 2D setting where the boundary between history evolution and science-fiction and fantasy must be smashed.Then it can be found that, although many passionately devoted otaku would emphasize that the 2D character they love and cherish is unique.According to the logic of cultural industry, the pictorial symbols identified as the same character in the animation, cartoon, video game or in the peripheral, garage kit and cosplay.Are really nothing more than specific combinations of some cute Mo E elements extracted from the database.And further implementation and presentation of such combinations in each specific world view setting, story context and media vehicle.Then how could the 2D characters built with combinations of cute Mo E elements keep attracting the attention of those otaku?One possible explanation that I cannot accept without reserve is as follows.Each of us lives in a society of strangers transformed and shaped by highly mobile market-oriented employment and large-scale urbanization.People in a society as such can be easily caught in a loneliness and alienation of atomic existence.What's more, the decline of grand narratives aforementioned make a commensurable and sharable social ethics standard hard to establish.Which further intensifies such an atomic existence dilemma.For these post-modern subjects, both people in the interpersonal relationships and those in the system of social rules.Are actually hard to act as the basis to determine the answer for our mystery of desire, rather, they pose disturbing problems one after another.Under such circumstances and in a 2D world.The diverse and fixed 2D characters provide with the otaku that lives in the digital world a convenient path to satisfy their lust and desires without the need for other mediums.Those cute Mo E elements that cultivate demands inductively and satisfy demands in a highly targeted manner can build closed and quick loops between deficiency and sufficiency in an inexhaustible manner for 2D users.As such, these cute Mo E elements, and specific combinations thereof.And the CP combinations between these elements can effectively serve as key words that are easy to search.It induces 2D users to call for content resources desirable from the big data ocean by means of various search engines.Also for this reason, they can effectively serve as discernible objects of desires driving these 2D enthusiasts to acquire a relatively stable source of pleasure from changing ceaselessly the story context and switching the world view setting according to their own interests.Such a phenomenon presents us with a socio-cultural trend worthy of attention, and proposes some crucial problems worth exploring.When the glamorous 2D illusion satisfies the appeal of meaning and emotional needs of post-modern subjects as an alternative.Is the grand narrative no longer necessary for the functioning of the human community?When captivating characters assembled from character setting elements and digital videos occupy new media interfaces of the post-modern consumer society, can we say that human are no longer necessary for intimate relationships?Furthermore, as more and more IP operation projects and MediaMix planings attempt to establish a whole industry chain connecting the animation and game with the film and television industries.More and more popular products combine such digital animation generated by computers with video materials from location shooting.Which creates fascinating phantom and make people addicted.More and more new technologies, such as the virtual reality technology and the augmented reality technology are commercialized on a large scale.The boundary between the virtual and real is also increasingly blurry and ambiguous.Then another question is that, will the opposing concepts of 2D and 3D that are built based on their differences become eventually out-dated.I've got no definite answers for such interesting questions.And I just want to trigger some thinking and discussion upon this topic, hoping to inspire more creative and in-depth reflection and discussion.That's all! Thank you for listening.Thank you!</seg>
<seg id=8>Well, that was a wonderful speech. And I'll elaborate a bit more on the part of dialogue.We can enter “unit.baidu.com” in the browser's address bar to reach the home page of the UNIT platform, then click "Use" to open the actual background management page.On the UNIT platform, the range of tasks that a robot can handle is defined as a scenario.Generally speaking, one scenario corresponds to a robot that handles a specific task.Therefore, I will use "robot" instead of "scenario" later to make it easier to understand.Next, let's take a practical case as an example to see how to build a robot on our UNIT platform to handle practical tasks.Okay, the first step,  click "New Scenario" and name the robot.For example, we now name a robot as Horoscope Assistant, which helps people check their horoscopes.Then click "confirm", and a null robot is created.We can see a new row is added.It's the discription of this robot.And it has some fields that discribing the current state of the robot.Then click view to enter the configuration page of the robot.Robot configuration consists of three parts on the UNIT platform.The first is to define what the robot can do.The second part is to define what knowledge should be taught to the robot so that it could understand human instructions.The third part, robot to learn, digest and absorb the knowledge.And I can verify online what capacities the robot has acquired and whether it has learned what we taught it as we expected.Each robot on the UNIT platform is made up of a number of units.Well, as Ke-san just said, it mainly consists of two parts. One deals with dialogues, and the other deals with questions and answers.Because it's a simple scenario,horoscopes,I mean, so we just need to create one dialog unit.Of course you can assemble a variety of units to build a particularly complex robot.A dialogue, by definition, involves at least one who asks and one who replies.When we define what the robot can do, obviously we need to consider things.One is what a user would probably ask for, and the other is under what circumstances the robot would reply.For the user request part, did you notice the two concepts mentioned before?One is "Intention", and the other is "slot"."Intention" refers to a task or a range of tasks that the robot is intended to do."Slot" refers to conditions required by the task.As for Horoscope Widget, obviously it is to offer horoscopes information.We can simply call it LUCK-SEARCH,and give it an alias "fortune teller".In this way, the range of tasks has been clearly defined.Then，the conditions.   Before we give out horoscopes,  we need to know your star sign and what day's horoscope you want to read.so we need two conditions, one is a star sign and the other is a date.On the UNIT platform, we realize this by creating slots.For example,  we are creating a condition like 'star signs', we can name it with this English word.Then, clarification, which means when a user does not clearly state his star sign, you can ask an extra question: what is your star sign?And then click "Next".We know that star signs are enumerable.There are 12 star signs.Therefore, we can upload a user dictionary in advance.I won't show you the dictionary, which may includes 12 word lists.and then click "Next".In this way, very simply, a slot of star signs is built.The second slot is for dates.But obviously dates are not as enumerable as star signs.If you follow the approach of our previous NLU tasks, you need to enumerate all dates, which is obviously impossible.But for the convenience of users, UNIT platform allows one to directly reuse the built-in capabilities of our system.So in the saame way we create a condition called "user_date".And the question would be "what day are you interested in?"As we see, UNIT has many built-in slots, such as movie names, person names, institution names.Users only need to check the box instead of uploading their own slots.For example, for Horoscope Assistant, I only need to select the built-in sys_time，then click "Next" and "Comfirm".In this way I have finished defining what users might ask.Our demonstration now might be a little too long.In practice it takes about only one minute to define what users might ask.Then the second part is situational response, that is, how the robot responds to a request.Now let’s enter a simple sentence, "OK,I'll check for you."We know that when we are actually doing an application, we need to add the resource retrival part in addition to the language understanding part.For example, when checking horoscopes, obviously you are curious about the horoscope for a certain star sign on a certain day.So before offering the service we have to collect all resources needed for the two conditions.And if these two slots are indispensable, you have some way to set them on UNIT.Here we provide a simple solution which can generate the conditions automatically with one click on "smart generation" instead of adding them one by one.The two auto-generated conditions indicate that only when a user has clearly stated the date and the star sign, the robot starts checking horoscopesOtherwise，it responds by asking for clarification. Then click "Save".In this way, what the robot can do is defined.To sum it up, we have defined what a user might ask, and the conditions under which the robot responds.This is the first part, teaching the robot what to do.Secondly, I need to prepare some knowledge for the robot, which it learns in a particular way to understand what I am asking him to do.In the interest of time,I'll upload a word list,uh,a sample prepared before.OK,let's look at an example.What does the robot need learn?To put it simple, horoscope is what we need to teach the robot when the user says “I want to check my horoscope".I need to tell the robot that the user's intention is to get his horoscope and no condition is stated.We just need to save this after the annotation.Or the user might make it clear he want to check Aries horoscope.Obviously what he intends is still to get horoscopes and one condition is Aries. Similarly, if he intends to check today's horoscope, we just need to label "today" as a date condition.If the user gives a complete sentence, "I want to check tomorrow's Taurus horoscope", then we just need to tell the robot that the user's intention is to get horoscopes and his two condition are Taurus, the star sigh, and tomorrow, the date.I annotated about ten samples to teach the robot how to respond accordingly when users say any of these ten sentences.I am using the ten samples to illustrate what our UNIT platform is capable of, that is, the robot can learn far more than the ten sentences after giving them the ten samples.When we have defined what the robot need to do, in Unit Configuration, and have prepared knowledge in Data Center, the only thing left is to teach these knowledge to the robot.On UNIT platform we add a button "Train and Validate".Select the sample that was uploaded just now, and click "Train".Then the robot starts the learning process. We are running out of time, so I'll show you the exact Horoscope Assistant we've done before.Let’s take a look at this.Its configuration is exactly the same.The user request part and the robot response part are the same.And in its data center, the same ten semple is used.It has been successfully trained. We will skip the machine training process.Now we can test what the robot have learned through these ten samples.We can make a comparison. What the robot has already learned is displayed on the right side.We can add an example to the left.For example, I say "get horoscopes", which is obviously not from the ten samples.But the robot has actually learned it，hasn't he?The robot responds by asking "what day do you mean?"OK, and I say "Next Saturday".OK,we can see that the robot has not only known the intention, but also recognized next Saturday as the date.And it asks "what is your star sign?"Well, we add a reply, "Aries".OK, in this way the slots are filled and an exact search is done, or in our terms, fullfilled.This is an example of a multi-turn dialogue.Let's look at an example of a single-turn dialogue to see how the robot would respond when we clearly state all necessary conditions in a single turn.Everyone can see these ten sentences clearly, right?Get horoscopes.Get Aries horoscope.Get today's horoscope.For example, now the user says, "Tell me next Sunday's Scorpio horoscope."Obviously I've never given the robot this sentence.But the robot understantds it, doesn't he?Let's try this.The robot can fully understand this sentence.It knows that the user wants horocopes, his star sign is Scorpio and the date is next Sunday.Let's see what the UNIT platform can do for developers for the input "next Sunday".It identifies next Sunday as a specific date, which is December 3, 2017.You can check it out.This is also a special feature of UNIT.The validation page，as we see, is where developers check how well the robot works.After the configuration, it provide a complete background service which can be called via API.In addition, we have now opened up an access to DuerOS, our Baidu's operation system.As long as you build a senario, or build a robot, on UNIT, you can submit it to DuerOS with one click.Of course DuerOS will review your submission.Once approved it will get into the DuerOS Skills Store.The Horoscope Assistant I just demonstrated has already been released in the DuerOS Skills Store.This is the configuration process of a simple scenario on the UNIT platform.Well, now let's welcome Ke-san.OK.Thank you, Xiaoming!Uh, at last I will brief you our entire development process.On July 5 we released the UNIT platform.And we made a lot of upgrades in four months.Actually on Jyly 5 we only released the understand ability of the dialogue unit.And in early August we released our SDK.You can directly use our SDK for voice capability. Actually we have an iOS SDK and an Android SDK.In September, we launched the Q&A unit.And we released the share function.Then in October, we launched Slot Regularization, which means you no longer need to define slots by uploding word lists one by one.You can define slots using regular expressions.In addition, our ASTAR contest concluded.More than 700 teams participated, over 200 entered the final round, and 8 won prizes.Now here we are in November.In this month, there are two things.One is we launched "submission to DuerOS", which means our two dialogue platforms,one ecosystem-focused and one technology-focused, have been integrated.Then on Baidu Create,we didn't have too many releases, but for financial serivces we announced a voice bank transfer function in cooperation with the Agricultural Bank.And we announced Top Seller for smart customer service.Besides, our Q&A robots for smart airport were also released there.In fact we have been supporting baidu's dialogue understanding techolologies as its brain.What comes next in December will be more interesting.I can tell you now that first we will be able to support commercial deployment.And next, we will release background management APIs, which allow you to pump word lists or to trigger training via API, in next month.And our chatbot, which you are waiting for, will be released next month.Then after December, next year, what I mentioned  are scheduled in the first and second quarter.And firstly, our QU and DM capabilities will have a major upgrade.I will give you the specific details then.Now I would like to keep a secrete.Secondly, for our training architecture, we will have a major upgrade concerning the stability of training and efficiency of validation, which is also scheduled in early next year.And we will upgrade our data management capacity in the data center.All these will be launched in early 2018.We have a lot more than these.My project schedule is pages long.I only picked out something that will come out soon. All these capacities are coming soon, with the efforts of all our engineers.Our platform was lauched four months ago, but it is vigorous and growing rapidly.And I hope that you could use it more and give us more comments and suggestions, which will help our platform to develp faster and better.There were lots of functions, you know, that were from our developers' feedback.We scheduled them as quick as possible and made them happen.The address of our UNIT platform is unit.baidu.com.You are welcome to visit and give it a try.Next, let's welcome Mr. Chen Jianhao, CTO of VeryStar, an important partner of Baidu UNIT, to share something wonderful with us.Please.</seg>
<seg id=9>Hello, everyone!Welcome to our advanced course on the UNIT dialogue system.I'm Ji Yousheng, an R&D engineer for Baidu UNIT platform.In this lesson, we will introduce the UNIT open-source dialogue management framework, the DM Kit.First, let's take a quick look at the overall structure of the dialogue system.In general, we can divide the task-oriented dialogue system into three modules: the dialogue understanding module, the dialogue management module, and the resource retrieval & task execution module.For example, a user inputs "help me book a standard room at Home Inn in Shangdi, Beijing for today" in the hotel booking dialogue system.The dialogue understanding module receives the natural language input, processes it, and then outputs the appropriate intent and slots.The intent here is to book a hotel, and the slots include the hotel name, room type and time of stay.The intent and slots will later be used as the inputs for the dialogue management module.The dialogue management module selects actions for execution based on the intent, slots, and the current dialogue state.So, in our example, based on the intent of booking a hotel and the slots such as hotel name, room type and time of stay, the dialogue management module decides to proceed to execute a booking.It then selects the 'book a hotel' action, and instructs the resource retrieval & task execution module to perform the operation.The resource retrieval & task execution module calls an external service to book the hotel, and sends the result to the user in the form of natural language.In this way, a dialogue interaction is completed.So, what is the framework of UNIT corresponding to this dialogue system architecture?To simplify, we can divide the framework of UNIT system into two parts, similar to the dialogue system modules we just looked at.One is the dialogue understanding service on the cloud.It parses the natural language input into dialogue intents and slots.The other part covers dialogue management,  resource retrieval and task execution.UNIT offers developers a choice of two methods to realize this part.The first choice allows developers to achieve simple dialogue responses using the response utterance configuration on the cloud platform.The second choice is to use the DM Kit, the offline dialogue management framework, and that is what we will focus on in this lesson.Using the DM Kit, developers can realize more complex dialogue process management and task execution.Later, we will look at the design principles and usage of the DM Kit in more details.But first, let's take a look at the abstract dialogue process in the DM Kit.There are two main concepts about dialogue in the DM Kit, namely dialogue state and policy.Dialogue state' refers to the state of a dialogue between the current user and the system. The policy can be understood as the most basic unit of dialogue processing logic.For each turn of dialogue requests, the DM Kit receives a natural language input from a user, accesses the the dialogue understanding module on the cloud, and then parses the natural language input into dialogue intents and slots.According to the intents, slots, and current dialogue state, the DM Kit selects the appropriate policy for execution.For example, if we choose policy A, the DM Kit executes the dialogue processing logic described in policy A.During processing, it may access external services or a knowledge base to get data, and generate utterances or commands as the final response of the system.Once policy A has been executed, the DM Kit updates the current dialogue state to the state specified in policy A, for example, dialogue state 2, thereby implementing the change of dialogue state.Next, we will take a closer look at the concept of policy in the DM Kit.A policy is the most basic unit in the DM Kit to process dialogue logic.It defines the complete behavior of the skills in a specific dialogue state.A policy is made up of three parts: triggers, business parameters, and reply contents.Let's consider these three parts in the context of the hotel booking example.The first part is the triggers.This defines the conditions under which a policy is selected.For example, we can define the trigger of a policy as the intent being hotel booking, slots being hotel name, room type and time of stay, and state being 001.While the dialogue system is in the state 001, a user inputs the sentence "help me book a standard room at Home Inn in Shangdi Beijing for today."The natural language understanding module parses the input and obtains the intent of hotel booking and slots of hotel name, room type and time of stay.Then the policy defined with this trigger will be selected for execution.The second part of a policy concerns business parameters.It defines the parameters to be used when processing the dialogue logic.These parameters can be slot values or function results.Developers can define the dialogue processing logic, obtain parameters, access external services, or execute functions to get the data needed for dialogue responses.In this example, we have defined three variables for the values of the three slots: hotel name, room type and time of stay.Lastly, we have also defined a function as a variable.This function books a hotel based on the previous three variables, and then assigns the result to this last variable.The last part of a policy is to define the output.For each policy, the output consists of three parts.The first part is condition assertion.It specifies the conditions to be met for using the current output.The second part concerns the result of the dialogue response.It can use the pre-defined business parameters to complete a template which can then generate and return an utterance.The third part deals with the state update.It specifies the system's new dialogue state after the current policy has been processed.At the same time it can also store parameters, and provide them for later turns of dialogue.In our example, we must first determine whether the result of the hotel booking is '1', that is,whether the booking is successful.If yes, we need to return the appropriate utterance to the user, and then specify that the current dialogue state needs to be updated to 003.OK, we just talked about how to define a policy.How does a policy take effect during the running of the DM Kit?Let's take a look at the service architecture of the DM Kit.At the core of the DM Kit is a dialogue management engine.In this engine, the dialogue process for each skill is defined in a json file, which includes many policies.When we run the DM Kit, each request first accesses the skills configured on the cloud, and obtains the parsing result.Then, the DM Kit finds the appropriate policy in the corresponding json file according to the skill ID and the parsing result.We have already introduced that functions can be defined as parameters in a policy.These functions now need to be defined and implemented in the DM Kit.The DM Kit has some built-in common functions that are provided as shared functions, including the operation for requesting external services to parse data.All skills can called directly.Developers can also customize functions and call them to meet their specific business requirements.Next up, we will take a detailed look at the configuration structure and usage of the DM Kit.The codes for the DM Kit are open-source and are hosted on GitHub.In practice, developers can implement the majority of dialogue process management via configuration.The configuration files for the DM Kit can be found in the conf directory.From top to bottom, the first file is bot_tokens.json.Developers can register in this file the api key and secret key that correspond to the skill on the cloud.This means that an access token is not required when making a request to the DM Kit.The demo directory contains the policy configuration files for our two demo scenarios.The json file for each scenario is the policy configuration loaded by the DM Kit.The xml files will be introduced later.The products.json file is used to register the skills and the appropriate policy configuration files.For each skill, the skill ID and file path of a policy must be registered in this file to ensure correct loading and execution of the policy.The remote_services.json file is used to configure the external service addresses to be accessed by the DM Kit service, including the UNIT's cloud address and any third-party services' addresses, which must be registered in this file to ensure access is available.The gflag.conf file is mainly used to configure DM Kit settings such as service port, request path and number of concurrent requests.Generally it's not necessary to change these settings.The core of the DM Kit configuration is policy configuration.Each skill needs to be configured with a json file, which contains a series of policies in an array.The configuration syntax of each policy element in the array should comply with the specifications defined by the DM Kit.This mainly involves three parts: trigger conditions, business parameters and output definitions.Here we list the main fields and descriptions.For more information, you can log in to our official GitHub page and refer to the detailed documentation.Developers can implement the dialogue management capability of a skill by configure the policy based on the dialogue logic.They can also define functions as parameters in order to implement dialogue logic that requires special processing or to access external services.After editing the policy file for the skill, we need to register it and its skill ID in the configuration file products.json .Developers can also register the api key and secret key of the skill to the file bot_tokens.This means that the DM Kit automatically gets an access token when communicating with the cloud, and the user does not need to upload a token when requesting the DM Kit.After editing the policy file and registering it, how do we test the performance of the skill?First, we need to download the codes for the DM Kit from GitHub and compile them.After compilation, we replace the configuration file in the output directory with the pre-edited file, and then run the DM Kit.The configuration of the DM Kit is modified with the file gflag in the conf directory, which contains the port and path of the service request.In general, we use the default configuration.Once the DM Kit is running, we can access the service interface of the DM Kit to test the dialogue.The interface protocol of the DM Kit is compatible with the dialogue interface protocol of UNIT 2.0.Developers can access the DM Kit service by assembling the json data according to the protocol.We also provide the Python script. Users can run this script to simulate dialogues with local DM Kit services.Of course, these operations assume that the skills in the UNIT cloud have been trained and can run normally.Now, I will introduce the DM Kit's visual configuration tool.We have looked at how to configure a policy so as to manage the dialogue process.For dialogues with many complex state changes, we can use visual tools to design and edit the dialogue process in the DM kit.Here we use the open-source mxgraph as the visual tool following four steps.Step 1: Edit the dialogue process on the draw.io website according to the pre-defined rules.Step 2: After editing the dialogue process, export the dialogue flow chart in an xml file, and store it in the configuration directory of the DM Kit.The xml file for the demo scenario we saw earlier was edited and exported using this tool.Step 3: Generate the json configuration file.The DM Kit provides a conversion script.Developers can run the program run.py in the language_complier directory, which converts the xml file into a corresponding json file.Step 4: After registering the json file and the corresponding skill ID following the same process as before, we can run the DM Kit to load and execute it.When editing a dialogue process with a visual tool, we need to follow certain rules.These rules are very simple, and we have defined several types of compositional elements shown below.The first type are one-way arrow lines.They connect to other elements, indicating changes of state.The second type ellipses.They indicate user nodes, in which are dialogue intents and slots.They correspond to triggers in the policy syntax we mentioned earlier.The third type are rounded rectangles.They indicate BOT nodes, where parameters and BOT replies can be defined.They correspond to the business parameters and outputs in the policy syntax.The last type are diamonds.They indicate conditional judgments.When different conditions are met, access to different output nodes is granted.In policy syntax, these are the conditions in the definition of output.Using these compositional elements, we can edit a complete dialogue flow chart.For example, this is a complete dialogue flow chart for the hotel booking example we looked at in the previous section.You can refer to lesson three for the detailed building steps for this example.OK.That's all for this lesson.Thank you all!</seg>
<seg id=10>Workplace politics has always been a hot topic of the day.We often talk about office politics under the context of state-owned enterprises, but many of my friends have asked me, "Do foreign companies not have to deal with workplace politics? Does power struggle not exist in foreign firms? Did Steve Jobs not be forced out of Apple after power tussle with the company's board? Evidently, office power struggle is way more cutthroat in foreign companies than in state-own ones, as people will go to any length to get what they want, even if it means to drive out a company founder.”I think workplace politics in foreign and private companies share one of the most basic premises, that is, the management serves the board of directors, who also own the company.For company owners, the most important thing is profit, and secondly, you don't get into trouble and you don't break the law.These are the premises and rules that dictate workplace politics in foreign companies.However, the situation is different in state-owned enterprises, because the management answers to government departments, such as the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commissionof the State Council.A government department cares not only about profitability but also whether the company will promote social harmony and stability, create employment opportunities, especially for the government leaders' distant relatives.That's why office politics is more intricate in SOEs.Therefore, office politics in foreign-invested enterprises is utterly different from that in state-owned enterprises, due to the difference in ownership.Chinese people are not interested in fighting, as it is always associated with shady, dirty and sneaky tactics.The Chinese language has phrases like "fight with open and secret means" and "watching from a hilltop while two tigers fight", which describe the fight as a low class and inglorious act.On the contrary, Chinese believe in the hermit-type life philosophy that advises people to endure, compromise, be worldly-wise and keep themselves from incurring troubles, instead of standing up for themselves.Chinese often talk about "one who restrains himself lives a safe life", "take a little step back, and you will find more space around you" and things like that.Some people even hang poems about endurance on the walls of their studies, to advertise their wisdom.However, such a philosophy of forbearance and compromise goes against the very essence of modern corporate culture.In modern business culture, we need professionals.What's the definition of a professional?You may think that you get all your work done, then you are a professional.To me, this kind of thinking is somewhat naïve.A professional must be able to do his or her job and do it well.That's the bottom line.More importantly, a professional should be brave enough to fight for the chance to showcase his or her abilities.If you don't have the guts to fight for your job, you will very likely be thrown off the stage without ever having the opportunity to shine.A professional should be competent for the job, dare to fight for the chance to do the job and can negotiate the deserving benefits for getting the job well done.If a person fails in any of the three aspects, he or she would be considered as lacking the overall skillset by the boss.Here, I want to clarify some misunderstandings people have about office politics.A common misunderstanding is that non-admin staffs need not get involved in workplace politics.This is a simple notion which is common among the diligent workers in a company.These people are under the impression that they will be safe in the office as long as they finish their work and steer clear of the power struggles.They just want to mind their own businesses, and stay away from other people's.However, many of those hard-working people complain about their jobs, why is that?Despite their competence, the job is assigned to someone with lesser abilities but good at office politics.Moreover, the diligent workers are being asked to do assistant work.Soon, they begin to feel unrecognized and unappreciated in the company.I find it to be peculiar that since you think you have outstanding business abilities, why not fight for a chance to shine?Why don't you ask for a stage to showcase your abilities?I want to share an example of a respectable woman.She's an advertisement copywriter from  "Mad Man", the American TV drama we just watched.This woman was a secretary in the 1960s in the United States. At that time, gender discrimination was rampant in workplaces, as a result, many females were only able to get junior positions such as secretaries.As a secretary, this talented woman came up with a brilliant advertisement idea, with which, she won the client over.Did she receive a promotion or salary bump for her amazing performance?No.This is normal, because every boss is selfish.If I pay you the salary of a secretary, you will do the job as a copywriter.What a great bargain for the company!However, this woman was not willing to accept the status quo.She talked to her boss and laid down two requests: first, the company should recognize her as a copywriter; and second, she must have her own office like the others.Her demands were granted.We can make a bold assumption that if she did not propose those requests, continued to work as a secretary at a desk in front of the boss' office, and got paid the secretary's salary, how would she feel about her job?She must feel unrecognized and resent the current situation.Would she continue to bring forth remarkable advertisement ideas?Her talent would be wasted, and her resentment would suppress her creative passion.Had she not fight for her own interest, her creativity would have been quenched, and her company would have  lost an excellent advertisement idea, which would have been a lose-lose situation.The lesson we can draw from this example is that it would be beneficial to the company, if an employee is good at standing up for his or her interest and fighting for his or her job.Another common misunderstanding of office politics is the notion that getting the job title is the same as getting real power, which is also silly and naïve.We have met people who are the general managers, presidents, and directors of their companies.As we started to learn more about them, we found out that they have no say in human resources or finance, they could not even accept a press interview because the headquarters would not allow them to express any opinions on the media.They can only distribute the press releases prepared by the headquarters, without further elaboration on the matter.These people may hold the title of a general manager, but in fact, they are doing the work of a regular business manager.This situation can be found everywhere.I want to tell you something similar in the fashion magazine industry, a business I'm very familiar with.When you look at the stunning magazine covers, have you ever wondered who makes the call of the photo?Who decides on which female star or supermodel to be featured on the cover?You may say:"it's the chief editor."Or some people would think it's the editor.It turns out that the chief editors don’t have the power to oversee the cover shoot.Someone from a higher level would say to them: "I don't think you can handle this. Let me do it for you."But the problem is, if you use the cover made by your superiors, then who is it to blame when the magazine doesn't sell?Of course, the chief editors are the ones to take the fall, because this is the responsibility that comes with the job title.You may argue: "I didn't shoot the cover, why am I the one to blame?"Then the general manager might say: "why don't you fight for your power as the chief editor?"If you go on saying that you have been treated unfairly in the whole process, your boss would consider you as lacking the overall abilities.You are the one to blame for not fighting for the power that comes with your job title.The power struggle between movie director Zhang Yimou and investor Zhang Weiping has also made the headlines recently.As the chief director, Zhang Yimou felt unfair to be forced to add a sex scene in the movie by the investor, which he didn't want in the first place.The power struggle is about a director's authority over a movie project, which is very complicated.The power tussle between directors and investors is universal.The movie producers want the project to make more money, but the director's job is to guarantee that the monetization process does not compromise the quality of the work.As the person in charge of the project, you should be able to minimize other parties' interference on your work; otherwise, you don't have operational capabilities to execute the project.This is the second misunderstanding I want to clarify.The third misunderstanding is the perception that every office power struggle is under the table, not on the table.I need to cite the examples from the hit palace drama "Empresses in the Palace"In the show, all the concubines cared about were who got to sleep with the emperor more and who was able to get rid of the babies from other pregnant concubines.They always said:" it doesn’t matter whether you have done the evil deeds or not, as long as the emperor believes you are innocent. "That is the typical ecology under the rule of man: there are no clear strategies, only conspiracy, because the only rule is that there are no rules.Human beings are emotional and unstable.If you implement rules based on your preferences, then you leave other people no choice but to fight dirty.Therefore, what we advocate here is for everyone to compete openly.We are pleased to see that many tactics of office politics are out in the open in China, such as the earlier internal power struggle in Gome and the fight between Wahaha and Danone.Some may say there are still conspiracies between the power tussle in companies.I will admit that there is still room for improvement in corporate regulations and systems, which will be refined through workplace power struggles.As a result, companies can have a more open, more systematic mechanism, which in return, will push forward social development.The last misunderstanding I want to address is the idea that every power struggle is destructive, not constructive.Let's take a look at these two women: one of them is a NPC deputy, the other is a CPPCC representative.A legislator and a political advisor are two pretty important positions.Although these two jobs are not full-time, at least they still count as part-time professions.These two women abide by the same principle: they don't abstain from voting; they don't vote no; they only cast the yes votes.I was shocked upon hearing this.I realized they had a rather easy job, which even my 3-year-old daughter was competent enough to handle.I could tell my daughter to sit still and raise her hand when everyone else is raising theirs.I think they might have forgotten their responsibilities.which are to be the voice of the people and to bring forth social advancement.They have neglected their duties.They are incompetent, and they should leave these posts.The type of political struggle we have advocated in the workplace is that by standing up for ourselves, we can perfect the rules and take our fights out in the open.An American friend once told me: "You need to fight. You fight because you are right!"I admire his attitude.If each of us is brave enough to fight for what we believe is right, and put our thoughts on the table, we will find out that what I think is correct he believes it is wrong, and what I see as incorrect, he regards it as right.After that, we pool our opinions together.Through communication and compromise, we refine the rule and respect the rights and beliefs of everyone, so that we can forge a better future for our company, our industry, and our society.So are you prepared?You fight because you are right!Thank you very much!</seg>
<seg id=11>So this is our last stop, and we came back to our headquarter in Beijing.I am very excited to have such a large and enthusiastic audience like you guys.So you have just now learned a bit about our speech technology. In fact, what we offer is a technology that converts speech, namely what we say, into text.My job is actually to support the voice technology.What we need to do, is to figure out a proprer way to interpret the information that a text conveys so that the machine could truly understand the meaning of the text.So my topic today is "UNIT Language Understanding and Interaction Technology".First, let us recall a bit, what is AI?It is actually quite simple. The concept of AI was proposed as early as in 1960s. Since then, scientists and IT engineers have been working relentlessly to achieve one thing, that is, to empower a machine with the capabilities of a human.So what human capacities we expect from the machine?As presented before, first we need the voice capability. We need the machine to listen and to talk.Apart from that, we need the ability to recogize images. As I mentioned, the machine need to recognize people and draw a certain images as well.It should also have the language competence that enables it to understand the language，i.e. to understand the actural meaning behind it.Finally, we expect that the machine have the ability to act, that it can excecute some operations autonomously.On top of that, we wish that the machine would be able to think, that it could think and reason as human do.In addition, we hope that the machine could acquire knowledge, for instance, it should be able to accumulate knowledage and use it during the process of thinking, just as humans do.Then, the last yet very important capacity that we expect from the machine is self-learning.Among all these capacities, I'd like to focus on the language capacity.First, why do we invest so much in language-related AI technologies?Because we believe that language is the carrier of our thoughts and knowledge.Why is language considered the carrier of thoughts?Think about it and we will find out that many of our thoughts and expressions are eventually delivered in the form of language.Just like now, I am giving my presentation through language to express my thoughts.Apart from that, we believe that language encodes knowledge and is the carrier to pass it on.Now, let's have a look at these pictures, they show the evolution of language from the Jiahu symbols in ancient times, then oracle bone script, to Internet images and texts of today.The form that carries knowledge changes and updates constantly. We will have even more forms in the future.But what does not change? Language doesn’t.Language enables us to understand knowledge. We have a 5,000-year culture.There are cultures that stretch even longer time, passing on over thousands of years dispite all sorts of obstacles.  The messages recorded by those languages may probably be the same.So we believe that language is crucial to AI.Then what do we expect in the modern era?Actually, we have entered the era of AI, and we expect language to play an important role here.What role is it?Over the past years, we have proposed the concept of "Dialogue as a Platform".That is, we expect to interact directly with a machine through dialogue, enabling the machine to understand what we say, and say what we expect from it.Now, let's watch a video.Xiaodu Xiaodu, how's the weather today?It is sunny today.Xiaodu Xiaodu, go to Kerry Center, Beijing.I have found three routes. Which one would you prefer?The first one.Xiaodu Xiaodu, how long will it take to get there?It will take one hour and 29 minutes to get there.Xiaodu Xiaodu, go to Joy City, Chaoyang.The route to Joy City, Chaoyang is planned.What do you wanna eat later?Hot pot.Okay!Xiaodu Xiaodu, search for the hot pot restaurants nearby.Which one to go?The first one.Start navigation.Xiaodu Xiaodu, let's drop by a gas station!The route to a gas station on the way is planned.The function has already been launched. You can just open Baidu Map and have a try.So, why do I show you this video?Actually, it presents a key technology which enables us to conrol a device easily and make it follow the instructions as expected through conversation.It actually involves capacities such as anaphora resolution, multi-turn dialogue, natural language understanding, and gerneralization of expressions.These capabilities are actually supported by our core NLP language recognition technology, which is supported by our UNIT platform.So these capabilities are available on our UNIT platform.Following the example, let's take a close look at the composition of the dialogue system.How does the computer generate such a dialogue?It simply involves two fields.The first is voice. When we say a sentence, the ASR module will convert it into a piece of text.Secondly, it goes to the NLP field.In this field, we use NLU technology to extract some core knowledge of a text, to figure out its intention.Then, we have dialog state tracking, fusing knowledge in multiple turns of the dialogue to determine the last action based on previous states.Next, with a module called NLG, namely natural language generation, we integrate the conversation history,  the information we expect the computer to express and the knowledage we have retrieved, to generate a passage that we expect.Then, we synthesize the speech through TTS and let the computer speak. This is the composition of a complete dialogue system.Such a system seems quite sophisticated, because it involves many key technologies.We have mentioned various voice technologies, including recognition and synthesis.As for NLP, you can see that there are many underlying technologies.In fact, more fundamentally, it also relies on some basic lexical analysis as well as massive user behavior data to learning, which enpowers it the capability of fluent conversation and generalization as we have just seen.So as a matter of fact, for a not-so-large R&D team like us, it's rather difficult to imporve these technologies to a state-of-the-art condition.But never mind, we have opened the platform.We opened UNIT to solve this problem, to enable our developers to achieve this kind of configurations via our platform.All we need to do is to make simple customization on intentions and slots, and provide a training corpus.Now, let's look at the specific supports provided by the platform.Firstly, as mentioned before, we have technologies. Secondly, we have strong capabilities for customization. We also have massive big data from the real world. All of these are offered as a package on UNIT.We wish to open our technologies and apply them to various products.Meanwhile, we can work with our developers to jointly create a resonant eco-system.This involves two most critical technologies. One is NLU, and the other is multi-turn interaction.Most importantly, the two critical technologies are supported by our fundamental technologies and data.Let's look at the platform in detail. Firstly, it provides the ability to understand intentions and slots.This is actually easy. For example, when a user says something which we call it a "query", our recognition module will recognize it as an intention of restaurant reservation.Then, we extract the key information from the query and normalize it, like the name of the restaurant, the reservation time and the number of customers.In real scenario like this, users normally would not give all key information to the machine in one go.For example, when we discuss having a meal together with our friends, we usually do not tell them "Let's go to Quanjude tonight at 6 p.m." at once, do we?We tend to express our needs step by step. So such a way of expression is actually crucial for us to express our needs.Therefore, it naturally comes down to our multi-turn interaction technology.Now, let's look at the example. "Please reserve a 10-people room at Quanjude for me."During this process, he actually did not mention the time of reservation.That's OK. Our machine will automatically ask me "What time would you like the reservation for?"OK. All we need is to say is, "Well, at 6 p.m.", then it's done.Besides, we can realize a simple extension via the platform, namely recommendation.For example, it can ask further "Do you need a taxi at that time to take you there?"OK. All we need is a simple configuration on the platform. Then the system will naturally recommend such a dialogue and guide users to continue customization.This and what mentioned on the last page constitute the conversational understanding ability in terms of  intentions and slots, which is the first function we provide on UNIT.The next comes to a situation encountered by many of our friends.That is, I have actually created a big Q&A dataset.But I do not intend to build an intention for each of the questions. All I expect is to pump the Q&A dataset into my system.Then when a new query comes from a user, for instance, about how to apply for these stuff.Then the platform will automatically find the most semantically similar answers from our dataset and recommend them to the user. In this way an intelligent conversation for the purpose of customer services or consulting services is finished.Such function is also available on our UNIT platform and was launched at phase II, approximately in September.Well, as I just said, all you need to do is to directly pump a  question&answer dataset into our platform and that is it.Then, after the platform receives some generalized questions from users, it will automatically search for answers in the pool, and finds the most pertinent answers for us.Similarly, a question & answer dataset in the category of customer service actually need multi-turn dialogue data. This is because when users ask questions, they usually don't know what they really expect.For example, a user expects to know about the loan application process, but he doesn't know what kind of loans we offer.That's OK. We actually need to guide him step by step with a multi-turn conversation. After completed the conversation, we recommend a result to the user.Such capabilities are also available on our platform.So we simply need to integrate the multi-turn conversation mechanism with the question & answer mechanism in order to complete a dialogue of this kind.As I mentioned before, the above-mentioned two capabilities are our two different solutions for a smart dialogue scenario.However, such capabilities actually are not fixed, but can be customized according to domain knowledge provided, logic of interaction and via model training. Users can then train their own models according to their business requirements.These models can in fact be customized on the UNIT platform.Although we just opened the UNIT to the public in July this year, we have been operating it in Baidu for quite a long time.So we have been accumulating some experience in different scenarios, such as smart customer services, assistants, household appliances, vehicle systems and robots.Now, let's see …I'll present two examples of what else the platform can do.Please play the video.Hello.Hello, Madam. This is the credit card service center of Innovation Bank, and my ID No. is 1005. I wonder if you have an Innovation Bank credit card in use.No.I'm calling to inform you that Innovation Bank has issued a platinum credit card that is free of annual fee permanently. It  granted with a minimum credit of twenty thousand to one hundred thousand, and guarantees free transaction for inter-bank withdrawls and desposits in different cities accross the country.Since it is a platinum credit card, I'd like to make sure if you have any other banks' credit cards in use for more than 6 months?Are you a bank staff?I'm just calling to introduce you our platinum credit card free of annual fee. You will be soon contacted by a manager of costomer service of Innovation Bank and you will have more details of the card.I have too many credit cards.Madam, it means that your are a longtime credit card holder and you have a good credit record!Please relax, I am just introducing the card, I am not getting you the card.We have a lot of promotions for our anniversay.  So I invite you to join. Why not check it out?Do you have any other banks' credit cards in use for more than 6 months?Yes, I do. It offers free lifetime annual fee.Yes. And if I need it, I will go to the bank.Madam, as you see, you work on workdays and bank counters are not always open. It would waste your time. Isn't it convienient to do it via a phone call?Excuse me. Do you have a stable job in Beijing?No, I have no job.Oh, it does not matter, as long as you have fixed income, repayment capacity and fixed phone number for contact.Do you have monthly fixed income?I retired long time ago.Oh, sorry. Thank you for your time.Thanks for taking my call. Have a good day.Good bye.It fails at last.But what I intend to show you is actually such a capability.That is our sales assistant system. The caller and the receiver are real person.We often find such a situation about our salespersons. Well, I wonder if you are familiar with this industry or not.What I want to say is that there are not many salespersons who are very good at selling and saying the right thing at the right time.In fact, most salespersons need a long-term training, during which they learn what to say under different circumstances. And the cost and time cost of the training are quite high.But actually what our system provides is such a function.During a call, the system pops up the most appropriate utterances for a salesperson based on the dialogue scenarios between two persons without much in-depth training. And the salesperson just need to read them out.In this way, the successful rate of sales can be greatly improved.On July 5th,we annouced a developpers contest called ASTAR.The contest actually had the full support of our UNIT platform.And the contest resulted in many interesting innovations.This is one of the award-winning works in the contest.It is done by students from University of Chinese Academy of Sciences.Now, let's watch a video. Play the video, please.Recommend me a recipe.What ingredients would you like to use? We have selected the following recipes for you.Sole fish.How much time do you want to spend on cooking? We have selected the following recipes for you.Half an hour.It's done.The third step is to cut the sole fish to small pieces, and marinate them with two spoons of cooking wine, a little black pepper and salt for 20 minutes.Wait for 10 minutes.We will remind you in ten minutes.Show me the picture!Next step.It's done. Congratulations.As you can see, it involves the combination of the ASR module and the NLU of our UNIT. Such a product was built by a team of 2 to 3 students.And it was a interesting product.Now, let's have a quick refresher on the core technologies we use at the background to support it.Firstly, the entire UNIT is such a framework that only requires developers to provide some customized goals and training data to start the learning process.Then through rapid validation and continuous optimization we can build a model based on the data. Then we can launch the model directly online, providing all users with the interactive understanding service at the cloud.The core is the technologies of understanding and matching.We have applied more than one set of technologies in the model. Actually, we have several sets of technologies working together, supporting the capacities of presetting, rapid validation and continuous learning.When combined, these capabilities can provide various functions including NLU and generalization .These are something more crucial, for instance, our intention recogniztion is a neural network model like this.It can achieve a accuracy of over 80% in the domain of movie and map, based on 2,000 pieces of data.As for our semantic matching, no customization or training is needed.I only need to pump dictionaries into the system.  Based on our semantic matching technologies shown in the middle,  we can map this user's query in natural language, at the bottom, to the question on the top.Moreover, data is also a driver of upgrading the model.Now we provide two mechanisms on our platform. One is knowledge recommendation, and the other is active learning.So we can automatically search for more expressions of questions in Baidu's big data and recommend them to you to use them in model learning.In addition, we have abundant capacities for dialogue management, supporting intention concatenation, intention change, slot change, clarification, and embedding.We also have some rules for cohesion and mechanisms  for state memory.All these are available on our UNIT platform.Now, let us take a look at our development.As I said before, we launched UNIT on July 5.Since then, we have had release and upgrade of related technologies every month.In December, actually this month, we worked out our proposal for commercial deployment. So you can consult us for more stable commercial deployment.We will launch our background resource management API this month.We will also release a chatbot, together with some preset scenarios this month.Next year, spoiler alert, we will release our strategy 2.0 at the beginning of next year.What will happen after the release?It is very simple. I just got the performance report for our final experiment yesterday.About 100 pieces of data were input into our model, which mocked the real scenario of a online product. We evaluated the precision and we got an precision over 90% and a recall over 80% That's what we can do with 100 pieces of data.We will open the model for you to use at the beginning of next year.Of course we have more than these. Our architecture for training, data analysis, and our capability to help you analyse user queries will all be opened at an appropriate time next year.So we would like you to use it and give us more feedbacks so that we could further upgrade our platform.OK, at last, I'd like to show you the URL, which is very simple, unit.baidu.com.You are welcomed to use it as much as possible. OK!That's my part for today.Next, let's welcome Ms. Li Jiarui, CEO of Bot Orange, an important partner of UNIT, to share with us a story of the cooperation of Baidu UNIT and Bot Orange.</seg>
<seg id=12>"There is nothing difficult for us to do in the world. If we deal with them, difficult things become easy; if we don't, the easy things become difficult."I believe you are all familiar with the saying.It’s from an article in a junior high school textbook entitled, ‘To Learn’.The article tells us a very simple lesson that there is no such things as difficult or easy.If you take action, difficult things will become easier; otherwise, easy things will become difficult to accomplish later.These things happen to us often, don't they?We all have lots of dreams that we want to achieve as kids, but how many dreams are fulfilled?I heard a story about a girl named Rain at the U.S. Pavilion during the 2010 World Expo.She found a trashed vacant in her neighborhood that was full of construction waste.So she wondered if it was possible to change that area into a beautiful garden?She took action.She took a pot of flowers from her home and planted them there.When she was about to plant the second one, she found her flowers were stepped on by a group of teenage hipsters in her neighborhood.However, she didn't give up.She continued to keep planting flowers.After a while, her action moved the once indifferent neighbors in her community and they carried out the recontruction plan of the beautiful garden together.In addition, every household in the community started planting flowers on their balconies, making the whole community more lively and colorful.I don't know how you felt after watching the video, but what I thought was, "Will things like this ever happen in our country? Will things like this ever happen in my community?"About six months later after watching the video, I went to Shenzhen for a volunteer project on June 2011.I visited a very beautiful beach called Xichong beach, in Nan'ao county, Shenzhen.At that time, the beach was not fully commercialized, so there were only guesthouses.Young people liked to camp there on the beach, and numerous tents were pitched along the one-kilometer-long coastline.We call it Chinese-style camping, but what exactly is that?You may have guessed it.When the young people left, they left many things behind. Like what?Garbage.Yeah, they left, but they also left the garbage behind them.Some of them even buried the garbage in the sand.So later people could hurt their feet when stepping on the garbage.I went there to swim, but when I saw what it looked like I hesitated.Can I swim in a sea like this?The waves came up and swept away a plastic bowl of instant noodles.Then another wave came and carried away some cigarette butts.If I swam in there, with one breath I might take in half of the noodles, and with another breath three cigarette butts.I couldn't swim in there.Should I just leave or take action?I thought about Rain and decided to take action.I wanted every visitor on the beach to clean it with me.I started to observe and found several groups of people packing up to leave.I ran over to help them and find out their leader.A girl shouted, "Don't forget your stuff".Oh, she must be someone in charge.You know, I went towards her to be the considerate Shanghai guy and I helped carry her bags.I carried her bags to their meeting point and she thanked me, "Thank you! Which group are you in?"Then she told me that people there were not from the same company, but were online friends who gathered together for a party.They didn't know each other very well."I am not with you guys, I am just a visitor." I replied."Wow! That's very kind of you.""But I am here as a volunteer.""A volunteer? Volunteer for what?""I am here as a volunteer to recruit more volunteers.""Recruit them for what?""It was nice of you to collect and take your garbage away, but you see, the beach is still very dirty, right?""Yes, indeed.""So is it possible for all of you to stay here for one more hour and clean the beach with me?""I don’t think we have enough time because we are gather for meals and we have a training after that. Plus, our leader is not around, he went to find the bus."So, I got rejected.I insisted."How about this? Let's make a bet. If I win, all of you will collect garbage with me, but if I lose, I will do it by myself."I wasn't really trying to make a bet.I just wanted to draw people's attention and let them know that, as a volunteer I don't quit easily.I went back to my place and grabbed a board game that we invented by ourselves.It's called ‘Green Walking’, to remind us to protect the environment and travel using low carbon emissions.So I told her male companions, "If any of you can rip the board game's cloth apart, you win. If you can't, I win."A few guys tried, but failed.Of course, because the cloth was made of special materials.Apparently, I won the bet.Eventually, their leader came back.So I asked him, "Excuse me, can you please do me a favor? Would you let them stay for an hour and do some voluntary work?""I am really sorry, but we don't have the time", he replied.I got rejected again.Then I insisted, "So how about half an hour?""I am really sorry but our bus has arrived. And the AC on the bus is already on.""So 15 minutes?""Let’s talk about it."Some of them were actually touched because of my persistence at the time.One of the guys came forward and said, "Fifteen minutes is okay. Come on, let's do it!"What he said moved his fellows and eventually all of them decided to join us.It took me about 15 minutes to persuaded 30 people to help collect garbage on the beach and they actually enjoyed it.On top of that, I could only have them for 15 minutes since Shanghai people are known for keeping their promises.So how could I finish cleaning a coastline of one kilo meter?At that time, I was different from who I used to be.You can see a picture in the lower right corner.There was a two meters high platform with 20 persons sitting on it eating sunflower seeds and tossing the hulls onto the beach.I walked over to them and asked, "Hey guys, can you clean the area in front of you so that we can move on to the next spot?""Who are you?""We are volunteers, all of us."A guy, whose name I believe was Jack, jumped down.There was also a woman beside him, whose name was probably Rose, jumped afterwards.“You jump, I jump.”After seeing them jump down and with 30 of us staring at them, the other guys felt embarrassed and decided to join us.Next thing you know, 50 people were picking up trash with me.The group leader was later very happy and asked the others to put the garbage in a pile and take a photo together.You may think that was the end.But no.I asked the group leader, "Boss, we cleaned the beach today, do you think the beach will stay clean tomorrow?"He replied, "No, I don’t think so. But there's nothing we can do".I asked, "Look, there is a wall on the dam, and it's grey. What do you say we paint some green graffiti on the wall, calling for everyone to protect the environment on the beach?"He answered, "That'll be great! We have two people in the group who can draw."So I said, "Okay. I’ll get the materials and you get the painters."Do you want to know what happened a month later?One month later, 100 volunteers came back and painted a 36-meter long wall.The story is far from over because those people enjoyed it too much.Six months after that, they thought the painting they did six months before was too subtle.When they came back, they found a 50-meter long wall and drew a painting based on the theme, "Become friends with fish and take away your garbage."Many people said to me, "Zhang Ning, you’re so stubborn. Only people like you would do something like that. What a stupid idea."Actually, we often hear things like this when doing volunteering work.What stops us from taking action?It's thoughts like, " I can't do it alone if no one supports me."Or "I can't make it by myself without the help from others."We always talk about other people.Let me tell you a story about one of our volunteers.She is a 30-year-old woman from Shanghai and her name is Wang Yan.She was one of our first batch of volunteers for the campaign "Smile for 100 days"."Smile for 100 days" lets volunteers go into impoverished areas in the mountains to help kids have fun reading books.Each of them stays there for 100 days.She was sent to Guizhou province, a place so remote that there aren’t any cars.Her health condition wasn't very good, yet she had to walk in the mountains every day.When she had the idea, she told her families and it was natural that they didn't approve.Take a look at this video please.She went there anyway, but I’m sure you want to know if she got her mother's support in the end?Well when she arrived in Guizhou, her mother was still not relieved.However, her mother's friend said, "You’re lucky because your daughter has a dream and is willing to chase it, even though it’s a lot of work. I arranged everything for my son, so he doesn't have to worry about anything, but he is not happy and is depressed."What her friends said worked , so she told Wang Yan, "Be safe and do whatever makes you happy."Moreover, after Wang Yan reached Guizhou, many of her friends found out that she went there to volunteer.So they wired her money, added credit to her phone and told her, "We can't go, so have fun with the kids for us."In fact, all of the opposing voices can actually help us think about the true meaning of our actions.If you want support from other people, let everyone know what they are supporting. Not because you’re pretty or handsome, but because you stand behind the meaning of your actions.So as long as you take action and you can prove that you are walking in the right direction, people will naturally support you.This is just one case.There’s also another.The person in the picture is Wu Haigang who is Malaysian Chinese.Ten years ago, he saw a public interest ad on TV about teaching in impoverished areas in western China.He was very touched.He decided to go to Yunnan and teach kids.Of course he got rejected when he told his wife about the idea.She said, "You’re too old for this. Why can't you just chill and take good care of yourself."He didn't know how to do this anyway, so he said, "Okay. Let’s wait and see."After waiting for ten years, he thought that he couldn’t wait any longer.He thought, "It won’t be long before I leave this world. I don’t have time to wait"Since last year, he started doing one thing.What was that?He told everyone he met that he wanted to teach in Yunnan province and asked if they could help him.A friend of mine introduced him to me. So he came to me and said, "Zhang Ning, I want to teach in Yunnan.""Why do you want to teach in under-resourced areas?" I asked."Although I’m a overseas Chinese, I’m still Chinese.I want to immigrate to Yunnan so that I can help those kids get a decent education" he answered.His words deeply touched me.I said, "Well, I haven't done any projects like that, but I'm touched by what you just said so I will help you."I found four public interest organizations: Smile Book Classroom, Love Contribution, Dandelion Library and Yongning Study Assistance.Based on his needs, we mapped out a nice volunteer campaign together and named it "Smile for 100 days".The volunteers went there to help children find the joy in reading and let them fall in love with books.The teachers told us that we truly helped the kids and lightened their burdens.The volunteers were happy, the teachers were happy and the kids were happy.I shared four stories with you.Did you notice what they all have in common?It’s that when we first had ideas and when we were ready to take action, we actually had nothing.Nobody gave us money or said they would follow us, but we took action anyway.Because we know that if we act, we will get what we want.Wang Yan told me something quite profound.She said, "So many things in my life were going against me, but the trips to Yunnan and Guizhou were quite smooth."Why?"Since my departure, I feel like I’m a magnet with positive energy and all of the resources are attracted to me." She answered.I am very honored to have invited the heroes of my two stories here today.Please welcome Wang Yan and Wu Haigang.Hello, everyone.I just want to say, "I hope that each of us can find our own inner light, stay firm and take off!""Because tomorrow will soon become yesterday, so we need to seize the moment.""Let's take action right now!"</seg>
<seg id=13>Let's start with marital relations.On a grand wedding, the mother of the bride talked on the stage to the sweet couple sincerely."The two of you come from different family backgrounds with different habbits and now you became a family. I wish you hold each other's hands for a lifetime. Please keep in mind that the truth of marriage is to respect and tolerate your life partner because the equation of marrage is 0.5+0.5=1."Hearing her words, the guests may react just like you, "She has surely learnt about the true significance of marriage from her own."But wait, is it true?Does marriage really mean "0.5 plus 0.5 equals 1"?I was whole in the first place.However, if tolerance in marriage means that we should turn from a whole person to a half, then why bother getting married when we can live a decent life alone in today's society?According to our study on intimate relationships,  "0.5+0.5=1" is an equation people made when marriage was considered as a life-time commitment that could not be broken.However, now the significance of marriage lies in the happiness and growth people get in a marital relationship.Therefore a healthy intimate relationship should be 1+1≧1.Nevertheless, what the mother said made sense because we indeed have to deal with various kinds of differences with our partners.For instance, there are differences between men and women, between our parents and us, between our children and us.A game women love most is the game of guessing.After being married for years, for every important holidays or our birthdays, our husbands will always ask what gifts we want for the occasion."Up to you" is our answer.We never tell them our exact ideas for we want them to guess.But husbands know nothing of romance and always make the wrong guess.We feel rather disappointed for we believe the ultimate love is when your partner gets you even if you don't say anything, that is love.However, men are strange creatures with different way of thinking.They argue that they couldn't have known since they cannot read your minds.So these differences exist in our marriage life for years.We think that our partner does not get us, we are frustrated at their behavior and we feel unloved.These differences take the toll to our marriage so we have to deal with them.As I study anthropology, I find Fei Xiaotong has the best explanation for differences when he was conducting ethnical research.And I quote, "Appreciate the values of others as do to one's own and the world will become a harmonious whole."He came up with it when he studied China's ethnic groups, believing that each ethnic group should maintain its own values and aesthetical standards.However, the values and aesthetical standards of one ethnic group may appear wrong even distasteful to another ethnic group.It is common that an aggressive ethnic group coerces another one to adaption in their early contact.During the process, the frequent outbreaks of ethnic conflicts make it impossible for a harmonious coexistence among people.But then we would discover that, well, after multiple interactions between different ethnic groups, we would notice that although their aesthetical and value standards are different from ours, they have their own values.With further communication, it turns out that one day we start to appreciate the different dances and religious beliefs.As we constantly enhance the mutual understanding and communication, we start to respect and advocate different values, and appreciate the differences.Due to the different values and cultural diversity, the world is getting more beautiful.Only in this way can we respond to the call of the Communist Party of China to build a harmonious society.We can also apply it in our family life for it works the same way.It is just easier said that done.Let me take a few examples.I bet you all know him, the hero of the most famous case of how-to-screw-over-your-father last year.He was a brilliant teenager with great artistic talent before the incident.Li Shuangjiang, his father, was very proud of his son's talent and shared in the show of A Date with Luyu.He said that, "I have always wanted my son to grow up freely and have the power to love.I gave him freedom so he could make great artisitic achievements.He said the mother was very strict and he disagreed with her, saying that only when the child was free to explore his artistic talent could he have a bright future.After things went wrong for Li Tianyi, the public unanimously blamed Li Shuangjiang for his parenting, accusing him of spoiling his son and claiming that he deserved it.But let's think it all over.Isn't it right to give our kids the freedom to grow?As we all know, it's necessary for the kids to know the rules and be strictly guided to obey the rules in the process of growing up.In the meantime, it's necessary to give them free space to grow freely.Both educational methods are essential to the kids.Spoiling is not necessarily wrong and strict education neither.Therefore, going to extremes should be avoided.Kids should be taught in both ways and the differences between the two educational methods should coexist.Obliteration and criticism against each other should be avoided.That is what cherishing each other's values means.Let the differences be as they have the very season to exist.But it's really hard to put it into practice, at least for me.Take a personal example.One day my daughter took back her math test from the primary school, I found her score was less than 80, the cut-off score.I talked to her softly, "Baby girl, let's find out together why you made mistakes and figure out how to correct them."I was satisfied with my amicable manner.Because I was good at parenting and didn't scold her.Then my husband returned home."Let me have a look at the test paper. I'm good at math." He said.He looked through the paper, "This is a careless mistake, I see. It doesn't count"."Why is the answer to this question wrong? Miscalculation? Can you work out the right answer? I bet you can. OK, it also doesn't count".In the end, he claimed that her actual score was 99.I wonder how he could let her realize her mistakes in this way.But I knew I couldn't challenge him in front of our daughter because we approached parenting differently.So I just waited to check the outcome.It turned out that she had made constant improvement in math from then on.Because she had faith in herself, believing she could do better next time everytime she made mistakes.At that point, she need to find out the right answers, but most importantly, she needed to build up her confidence.So I figured the meaning of the saying "the differences have the right to exist" is that when others have different opinions, it is possible that they are right.Just like dating is different from marriage.We are pleased to find out that our boyfriends are very generous, a loyal friend with many people around, but after we marry them, we start to complain about him not taking care of the family or being busy with business outside.Actually it was not their personalities but the scenarios that have changed.Before the marriage, husbands are proud of the pretty and submissive girlfriends, but after getting married, they feel exhausted by the over-dependent wives who can't do anything on their own.Those are identical features in different scenarios.Therefore, "to appreciate others' values" is to see the shining points of people.It is really hard to change people for it is a matter of personality.If we just focus on the strengths of others, they will be encouraged to do better in the right areas.In fact,  differences can bring us more benefits than we thought.I lived in the US for quite a long time.Despite the safe traffic there, I never gave a thought to driving on my own due to my poor sense of direction and bad driving skills.Driving on the American highway, for me, was scary.In the October of last year 2012, I and my husband went to Los Angeles to stay there for five days.However, when we were in Los Angeles he told me that he needed to stay in San Francisco for 2 days.In my opinion, it would save more time by plane.But he insisted on hiring a car and driving there.It takes seven hours to drive from Los Angels to San Francisco, so it's 14 hours back and forth.For me, driving for 14 hours in two days to finish the round trip was scary.I refused to go together but he insisted.I gave in at last for he accompanied me in this American trip to attend a conference, so we hired a car and hit the road.To my surprise, the highway from Los Angels to San Francisco was such a feast to the eye.I couldn't be more impressed.On the way, my husband shared with me his understanding of the US and the life, then I got to know his dreams and ideas.If it hadn't been my husband, if there hadn't been the differences between us, I could never have tried things like this and I would thus miss those beauty in life.Thanks to him who is different from me, I can embrace a world different from mine.When we encounter problems, we can come up with two different solutions.We offer our child two options.We tell her that, "Whenever you encounter a problem, mum may tell you to do like this and dad could say a different thing."Our kid said, "Ok, I have to think over those two options and figure out which one is better."Our life becomes extremely wonderful and interesting because of the differences.That is the harmony after we appreciate the values of others and our differences.At this stage, we would find out that a true intimate relationship is not defined by desperate love when we can't survive without each other.On the contrary, we should be able to live a better life without our loved one around.Life is better when I am with you and I am better with you because you feel the same way.Only then could an intimate relationship give out the positive vibes.For only when there is the power of love could we embrace the differences.Only when we constantly experience conflits could we figure out our bottom lines and how far we would compromise.Only then could we discover the beauty of a harmonious relationship.We live on the one side and enjoy the grass the other side.From now on, let's learn to respect and appreciate the differences, to enjoy the diversified and beautiful life.Thanks!</seg>
<seg id=14>Thank you!Charles Dickens once said, "It was the best of times, it was the worst of times."You can tell from Jiang Changjian's physique that it's the worst of times, for the mobility is quite insufficient; but judging from mine, you can tell that it's the best of times, for the mobility is rather high.Well, back to Jiang's question, why is Shanghai?To answer this, we have to trace back to 170 years ago.After the Treaty of Nanking was signed, Shanghai became the second of China's five trading ports after Xiamen in 1843.Since then, Shanghai has developed at high speed.And it has been 170 years since Shanghai's opening to the world.After its opening up, the Great Powers came to Shanghai one after another.Instead of taking it as they did to Hong Kong afterwards, they enclosed lands in Shanghai, which were called concessions.Little by little, concessions became a cultural form and the existence mode of foreigners.These concessions connected with the development of Shanghai in the 170 years closely.Let's take a brief look at the two stages of the development of those concessions.At the first stage, when the foreigners just arrived at Shanghai, do you know what their lives were like?At that time, only foreigners were allowed to live in those concessions.People called it "segregation of foreigners and the Chinese".However, till 1853 and 1855, a large number of Chinese refugees swarmed into those concessions due to the insurrections of the Small Swords Society.The state of segregation collapsed and the residence of both foreigners and the Chinese could live in the concessions.Therefore, the history of Shanghai was changed, showing three histoic trends.First, its economy started to thrive.Second, plenty of Chinese and western cultures were gradually integrated into a whole in those concessions.The two trends renewed the historic and cultural features in Shanghai, which can be characterized by the following aspects.First, pursuit of innovation.Because it accepted the influence from the western world.Second, assimilation of western cultures.Third, mercantilism, for Shanghai attached much importance to commerce.Fourth, praise of common customs.Shanghai's culture is one for the citizens on the whole.It is also very popular and down-to-earth.That was why men of letters of the Peking School represented by Shen Congwen called its culture as Shanghai-style culture.Today we use "Shanghai-style culture" as a commendatory term.But at that time, it was a derogatory term.This was how Shanghai's culture tended to be.As a result of such historic characteristics, Shanghai's management form was also unique, which was called "country in a country".To be specific, foreigners were mainly in charge of those regions, with a large number of Chinese people living there. However, the Chinese government had no control over the regions. Isn't this interesting?So the concessions became a grey zone out of control.So you could find all kinds of people there.For example, adherents of the previous dynasty such as Xu Hongji, Zeng Chunxian and Zheng Xiaoxu,Kang Youwei, a member of a revolutionary party wanted by the Empress Dowager Cixi, and Zou Rong and Zhang Taiyan, whose articles caused shock at home and abroad.The New Youth by Chen Duxiu was also founded in Shanghai.But its headquarters were moved to Beijing when Chen was appointed Chairman of the Chinese Literature Department at the invitation of Cai Yuanpei.The magazine triggered the May Fourth Movement and the subsequent New Culture Movement.Besides, the First National Congress of the CPC was held in the French Concession of the Luwan District in Shanghai.Mayor Zhou is also present today.He was a leader of the Luwan District at that time.Think this, in the French Concession, you can find various political factions and political powers.Meanwhile, all kinds of cultural thoughts and arts began to develop rapidly, which was a trend at that time.Lin Mingjie just gave a speech on art.He is specialized in commenting painting and calligraphy.I'd also like to share with you an example of Shanghai School painting.In the past, you must come to Shanghai if you want to make some achievements or money in painting.Of the "Big Three" of Shanghai-style painting, only Xu Gu was from Shanghai.Wu Changshuo was from Huzhou and Ren Bonian was from Shanyin County of Shaoxing City.Wu Changshuo spent his later years in Suzhou.Although he wanted to sell his paintings in Shanghai, he dared not come without discretion, for he considered Shanghai to be the paradise for adventurers.So he entrust the undertaking to one of his students, Zhao Yunhe, to take the first step.Sure enough, Zhao Yunhe made large profits there in just a year.Today, Zhao's paintings can still be seen at many auction shops.They are just potboilers, so to speak, and far from his teacher's in quality.We can also see from Wu Hufan's diary, in which he had low opinions of Zhao.Wu Changshuo was surprised that Zhao could make so much money with his lackluster paintings.So, at the generous invitation of Wang Yiting, the general agent of Nissin Company then, Wu moved to Shanghai, and thus starting to make contributions to the development of Shanghai School painting together with Ren Bonian and Xu Gu.Well, put it this way, there wouldn't be so many prominent artists such as Wu Changshuo, Ren Bonian, Zhang Daqian and Liu Haisu but for Shanghai.People keep discussing where the origin of China's oil painting is？It's actually Shanghai.But why is it?After its opening up, a lot of foreign missionaries came to the Xujiahui Catholic Church in Shanghai.And later, the missionaries in the church set up the T'ou-Se-We Museum, which is now generally accepted as the cradle of China's painting.Though having a good name, the Museum was actually an orphanage.To ensure that the wretched and homeless orphans could learn professional skills and rejoin the society, the missionaries from various European countries inspired children with art, on which they could survive when they left the orphanage.As we know today, some of the artists from there loved the common people a lot, like Zhang Chongren, the well-known sculptor.Zhang Chongren is the only Chinese artist well remembered in Europe as the best friend of Ryan, the creator of The Adventures of Tintin.Some even said that the image of Tintin was drawn from Zhang.In the late years, he was deemed a master in France.He created sculptures for Mitterrand and Debussy.And that was why, as people said, he had free access to the Élysée Palace.Another artist from the orphanage is Zhou Xiang, the teacher of Liu Haisu.If it weren't for Liu Xiang, there wouldn't be such an artist as Liu Haisu, and the education of China's oil painting initiated by Liu wouldn't exist either.The Shanghai Academy of Fine Arts founded by Liu was the first in China to practice human body sketch.At that time, it was incredible for a girl to serve as a nude model under the gaze of many male students.But Shanghai offered an open and generous mind for China's paintings, especially for oil paintings, to secure long-term and sustainable development.Now let's divert our attention to Peking Opera.In Beijing, when going to a theatre, the Shanghai people would call it watching an opera, but the Beijing people would rather call it listening to an opera, for they only put emphasis on what they hear.However, when Peking Opera spread to Shanghai, it took on the local features and became the so-called Shanghai-style Peking Opera, which focused on both audio and visual contents.For example, there was an artist who was deemed the representative of Peking Opera.But I could say that had it not been for Shanghai, he wouldn't have achieved considerable success as an artist and exerted such great influences on people who love Peking Opera from his times till now.The artist is Mei Lanfang.In 1914, when he was 20 years old, he came to Shanghai for the first time.At that time, he was just an ordinary opera actor of Dan role (female role) unknown to the Shanghai community.So he was not a supporting actor then.The leading actor was a Sheng role actor named Wang Fengqing.You can tell the difference from their wages.The wage of Wang Fengqing for 45 days of performance was 3800 silver dollars, but merely 1400 silver dollars for Mei Lanfang.And it was only at the repeated requests of Wang, Mei's wage was raised to about 1800 silver dollars.However, when Mei came to Shanghai again, he became the leading role, with a wage of about four thousand to five thousand silver dollars, while Wang's had been cut in half.Actually, Mei's first performance in Shanghai in 1914 was very important, even for his entire life.On one hand, he found the stage here was splendid and much brighter than those in Beijing, though not very big.Why?Several bright bulbs were lined at the front edge of the stage, which might be neon lights or LED today.That was a novelty for him, and he thought the setting to be gorgeous.And it was the first time for him to see follow spotlight on the stage of Peking Opera in Shanghai.You can see that there are also many on this stage.At that time, the opera stages in Beijing had no such things.On the other hand, he also found that actors of Dan role in Shanghai looked more beautiful than those in Beijing.Through careful observation he puzzled out the reason, eyeshadow.Beijing actors were lightly made-up at their eyes, so that their eyes didn’t look big and bright enough on the stage.Meanwhile, Shanghai actors had heavy eyeshadow, so their eyes with heavy dark circles looked much brighter and bigger under the spotlight.When he asked about it, people said that Shanghai actors of Dan role drew much helpful experience from the Hollywood films.Apart from eyeshadow, we know that Peking Opera actors use fake hair.Back at that time, Beijing actors often paste fake hair in a square shape, which made their face shorter and not pretty enough.But he found that the way Shanghai actors did it was different.In the following forty years of performance, Mr. Mei summarized the tips to paste fake hair.Shanghai people did it in quite brilliant ways.Ways to paste fake hair depended on actors' face features. Do you know it?For actors with slim faces, fake hair should be pasted backward to make their faces look bigger.Jiang Changjian is of such a kind.For actors with plump faces like me, fake hair should be pasted forward, almost on this area.For short faces, it should be pasted higher, and the fake hair itself should be shorter.And for long faces, it should be pasted lower.The ways of pasting fake hair were fairly inspiring for Mei.Therefore, the Mei School Art he created afterwards, as well as his gentleness, elegance and generosity on the stage were attributable to his staying in Shanghai and learning from the actors of Shanghai-style Peking Opera.Those were all that lied on the surface.Do you know what more important thing was?It was in Shanghai that he learnt the innovation spirit, which enlightened and astonished Mei a lot.After returning Beijing, Mei did a lot of work with his fellow actors, and together they rehearsed plenty of new operas such as Yi Lv Ma and Deng Xia Gu.Innovation was an important thing throughout Mei's entire life as an artist, so to speak.In his remaining years, the last opera he rehearsed, Lady General Mu Takes Command, became the most representative one of his eight prominent operas.The opera was originally a Yu Opera from Henan Province, and Mei borrowed it from Ma Jinfeng, a master of Yu Opera.So I can say that if it weren't for Shanghai, Mei wouldn't become a master of Peking Opera.What impress us most on the streets of Shanghai today are definitely those world architecture groups in the Bund.Of those architecture groups is a style called art deco.It lasted no more than 20 years in Europe.Except Czechoslovakia, Shanghai boasts the largest amount of art deco buildings in the world.Shanghai is so captivating. That's why Laszlo.Hudec, a wanderer, could fit into this city.Besides, it is also too numerous to mention Shanghai's movies, dramas and pop songs.The city is always a smelter that can take in literature, drama, music and other art forms.All these factors ensure that Shanghai will continue to be the spotlight of the world.During the 170 years, Shanghai has developed from a small coastal county into a magical city that draws worldwide attention.We can conduct studies on its development course to find the reason.I remember a comment of Shanghai by The Times that Shanghai is the darling of the times and the mixture of history.This can also explain why ideas, artists and artistic atmosphere are diversified in Shanghai.Well, now you must know the answer to the question, why is Shanghai?Thank you!</seg>
<seg id=15>Good evening everyone.The topic I want to talk about today is, "i-music, i-Love, and i-Think."Our host has introduced the meaning of ‘I’.It represents the ‘Internet’ and ‘me’.In today's society, the Internet revolution is bursting  and every industry is being influenced.Every one of us is inevitably facing a choice.Actually, there is no choice, but we think there is one.The choice is whether we go forward or step backwards.Since life is limited, there aren’t many choices.And for us, the possibility of avoiding confusion, suspicion, agony and sadness is very low.So what else could help us besides self-empowerment?Actually, the heavens, God, Buddha, or whichever name we give it, did leave us with a solution: music.Music is the genuine Band-Aid to our heart.Music is our only hope.Music never asks us for anything, but we can obtain strength and confidence from it.We can find comfort, consolation, and love to heal our wounds.We may have many embarrassing moments that we cannot share with anyone, but we can find the best listener in music.Instead of listening to music, I think it's more likely that music is listening to us.So ‘i music’ means, "I am the music, and the music is me".Everyone is a natural musician when they first come into this world.We have an instrument in our throat called the vocal cords.Let's not use our throats just for talking, but also for singing.Singing gives our spirits a new look, and it provides a very specific direction towards our dreams every day.It dims our agony and sadness or makes it disappear, even if it's just temporary.I've brought some videos with me. Let’s watch them together, and see how other people perform music.I selected some of the content for you because our time is limited. You can find these videos on the Internet without a VPN.This is an ad from Apple.It tells us an idea that, "less is more."We didn't bring anything with us when we were born, and we won't take anything with us after death.A wealthy man once said, "Shrouds have no pockets."We can't take anything away after death, but we can leave something on this planet.What are you leaving?Learning music is learning to love.We know how to love while learning music.If  music is everywhere in our nation, our society, our country and our families, our differences will become less important, and many disputes can be avoided.It can even reduce the downside of human nature.Is music really that amazing?Yes, it is.We often say that the end of languages is the start of music.The prototypical form of music existed before humans even learned any languages.Primitive people communicated with each other by making sounds and gestures, according to what we've learned until now.You know, I didn't learn how to play the violin when I was a child, but I want to tell everyone about the ‘i Love’ in ‘i music’.As long as you have love, anything can be used as a way to express your desires, feelings, affection and unconditional love.So what will I play for you today?I will play the violin on the iPad that everyone probably knows about.Here we go.Every tablet computer has a thing called a ‘gyroscope’, which creates a high and low pitch according to its level.So this is a highly sophisticated instrument that’s definitely not sillier than humans.There are 65 kinds of instruments in it, like the violin, cello, and so on.Is playing it with this the same as using real instruments?Does the form matter?No, it doesn't.But being happy matters.The point is to be happy, isn't it?Don't turn away happiness if you have the chance, because it's not easy to come by.The elites created it with their creativity, persistence, and hard work.They brought happiness to every one of us.So, don't refuse to be happy.Let happiness into your heart and make you truly happy.How can we be happy?The easiest way is by turning words into a song.We came to TnDao today to hear something.Listen to this.TnDao, TnDao, we are at TnDao today.Happy, happy, everyone should be happy.Wasn’t that fun?Is it your dream to turn your words into a song at any time?When you see a stranger and feel a little bit awkward, you can use this app and play "a sentence at one time" with them.I’m sure a love letter will be finished soon by doing this.Don't be afraid of going forward.New things make our boring and ordinary lives interesting.They bring light to our seemingly endless hard lives.I'll tell you the names of both apps.The first app is called, ThumbJam.The thumb is the first digit on our hand.T-h-u-m-b-J-a-m.It's a music studio, and both professionals and amateurs can use it.The second interesting app, which can turn words into songs, is called Songify.Song, s-o-n-g, and then i-f-y.Combine them, and they become one word, s-o-n-g-i-f-y, Songify.A graduate from Stanford created this with his girlfriend.At first they created a voice engine, which could change voices.They spent 15 months developing it, then sold it to a listed company and received $19 million.Maybe you think this is simple, but actually, it can go both ways.Sometimes an idea could not only change your life, but also the world.I haven't played much music in the past few years, but I've tried many times to compose.I combined the elements of Buddhist music with the piano, the king of western instruments.Let's see if we can hear the voice of Buddha in it.</seg>
<seg id=16>I've just finished my work as the supporting male of the soap opera Spring in the Office.I heard that many made fun of me for not being good-looking enough to act.Let me make it clear. The director would like an instinctive actor as the president of a company in the opera, so they searched online "The top ten handsome presidents in China".I don't know how I stood out in the appraisal, but you won't believe who those candidates were.How could I not be chosen among people like Jack Ma and Shi Yuzhu?This reminds me of a famous saying by Jack Ma — A man of wisdom is often not good-looking.Don't you think he is a perfect example of this saying?I personally think him as the most intelligent of our kind.Well, let's go down to the business. I'm here today to share with you the lessons I learnt from my past life.What is life?As for me, it is a journey.A journey always has its destination, and all humans share a common one, whether you choose it or not, it is waiting for you at the end of life.When reaching the destination, the greater ones can have their portraits on the wall,In China, places are limited, most of which have already been taken.So, when you become aware of that, you really don’t need to pursue it, for you can't avoid it anyway.Well then, what is the most important thing in life?I believe it's the process.Since it is a process, there will be laughs, tears as well as storms.We always hear that a life without hardships would be incomplete.From this point, I reckon my life to be more complete than any one of you.You know what I mean.Back in 1990, 24 years ago, I was a post graduate student pursuing a degree at the Nagoya University.I didn't mention that I was pursuing a doctor's degree, just keep it low.At a regular result presentation, my supervisor Itakura Fumitada was not pleased with my work and said, "Maybe you can write a paper with such a result back in your country, but it's not possible in Japan."Hearing this, I felt a sting in my vulnerable heart.Not being able to put up with it, I angrily slammed the materials down on the desk.The action left me with only one option, for I actually had to make a decision.What was my decision?It was to antagonize my supervisor; what I chose was to leave Japan; what I chose was to let go of the degree for which I was yearning and made strenuous efforts for five years, a degree that I would had acquired in merely six months.Many asked if I have ever regretted, regretted of the slam and the decision I made.My answer was no, not because that choice led me to Microsoft and made me who I am today.If I had not done so, Itakura Fumitada would never have said that I was the best of his students 20 years later; If I had not done so, the president of the Nagoya University would never have told me that I was a distinguished student of the university.That choice mattered because it preserved a little of my dignity and made me more self-assured before them.Later on, to make up for this, I took an on-job postgraduate degree in a third-rate university in America.However, I didn't foresee a huge disturbance on the internet 20 years later.A lot of people criticized me for my "academic misconduct".During that time, many asked if I felt depressed about it.How could a man in that situation be depressed?I didn’t feel that way but I did feel at rage and helpless.Then, how do you define depression?Before the Spring Festival of this year when I saw a kid of my family smoking in the toilets, I said to him that it was inappropriate to smoke when he was in middle school."I am depressed about the Diaoyu island issue." He answered.That state of mind could be described as a sort of depression, but how could mine be like that?The same day as today twelve years ago, I was already the president of Microsoft China.In those days, Internet industry was still at its infancy.With Internet, what kind of applications is the most frequently used?The chatting apps.At that time, Microsoft rolled out a chatting application called MSN, whose market share was much larger than that of its twin in China, Tencent QQ.However, I found that the growth rate in user number of QQ was much higher than that of MSN.I noticed there was only one function of QQ that MSN didn't have.What is that?Chatting with strangers, as you could see.I told Gates that and warned him, "We will lose to Tencent if we don't provide that function.""Why do Chinese people love to chat with strangers?" asked Gates."That's a need of all humans!" I answered.He didn’t believe it and said, "It must a particular need of Chinese men."Let's think about this, what kind of psychological states it takes for a man to chat with another man all day long?"No, it's a mutual need" I insisted.Gates finally accepted my opinion and became willing to provide this function only to the Chinese market, with a condition, though.The Microsoft China must promise that MSN would gain 1.5 million dollars of income from advertising in three years to compensate the expenses in development and maintenance.What in front of me was that I needed to make a decision, however, there is no other options.Why not?Because I dared not.Why did I?Because I cared the position too much to lose it, so I dropped the option.What is the consequence of that decision?As we known, MSN was finally weeded out of the market last year.I wonder that if I had made the decision then, perhaps the Internet pattern in China would have been changed dramatically; if I had made the decision,  maybe Ballmer, who I appreciated so much, wouldn't have to resign.I think that's why people say that the delight of life lies in infinite choices, for you can't foresee the consequences.Some asked me what the biggest lesson I learnt from all my experiences.The answer was to have the courage to make choices.Another question is how I made it through in my most difficult times when I encountered hardships.As for this, I'd like to share with you Tang's method of bottom-line stress reduction.Let's stay low-ley and I'll just call it bottom-line stress reduction method.So, what is that?I just get prepared for the worst scenario and think of the countermeasures that you will take when the worst happens.What will you do then?Do you stand for the outcomes?When caught in the Internet disturbance a few years ago, I thought to myself that the worst scenario would be a divorce.Many said that " Tang Jun, I can't believe what you think of now is women."It's difficult to be a man, you know, not to mention being a good one.Even so, I am well aware that half of the happiness of a man comes from a woman.However, man is the single source of a woman's happiness.When thinking about this, I feel quite relaxed.This is how I relieved stress in my past life, with a so-called bottom-line stress reduction method that I decided.I like to say that many of you here today don’t need courage to be here at TnDao.Before I put an end to my speech, I'd like to say that you do have good tastes to come and listen to me.Thank you!</seg>
<seg id=17>I'm a lawyer.I was asked by one of my friends a few days ago, "You've been in the business for more than 10 years, what's the most unforgettable thing in your mind?"I think about it, and suddenly realize that the most unforgettable thing is not a case with over 100 million yuan of Subject of Contract, nor court hearings that took place at the Supreme People's Court.You must find it unbelievable.My most unforgettable case is one that involved only 475.83 yuan.In 2005, I handled a small case. At that time, I had only a few years' law practicing experience.My client was a newcomer to our city.He rented an apartment there.Later he found a job in another city and therefore he needed to move out of the apartment early.That is to say, he needed to cancel the house leasing contract with his landlord.It was nothing complicated.My client had paid deposit to his landlord, and it was up to the landlord to deduct any reasonable cost from the deposit.It was a simple mathematics.And eventually the landlord was required to return 475.83 yuan to my client.It was rather simple, nothing complicated.But this landlord seemed to be obsessed by some devilish idea, kept making all kinds of excuses and refused to return 475 yuan to my client.I guessed that he was thinking, "You're a newcomer here, what can you do? You can never have this 400 yuan back."My client refused to accept it.He entrusted a lawyer, which was me, and filed a lawsuit against his landlord in court.It is such an insignificant matter, and by no means it should be escalated and become a lawsuit?However, to my big surprise, this landlord, by leveraging his local connection, succeeded in winning the first-instance judgment.In other words, the court judgment said it was right for him not returning 475 yuan.Let alone the feeling of my client.It was a serious setback for me, a new lawyer in the business.It would directly affect my outlook on life and the judgment on values.In any case, we must file an appeal.In the Court of second instance, we made our utmost efforts to fight for our point of view, presented convincing proofs and finally the final judgment came out.He was asked to return the money to my client.But to my disbelief, the case was never a simple one.The landlord refused to accept the court judgment, and this case eventually entered the execution phase.The execution phase was not complicated either.The judge asked both litigants and me into his office, and required the landlord to give 475 yuan of cash to my client face to face.One thing unexpected happened when we were about to leave the judge's office.The landlord suddenly pointed angrily at my nose and shouted, "Ren Zhijian, I'm not afraid of you. Let's wait and see."At that moment, my brain literately went blank.I can't believe that this man will behavior in such a silly way for the sake of 475 yuan.I ended up leaving the Court from its back door.It is a great fortune of me for not meeting this guy these years.I hope that he won't be present for today's event; otherwise I will be in trouble.When looking back at this case, I now realize that it is more than a joke.Why is someone willing to break rules, to break simple rules of a house leasing contract, in exchange for 475 yuan?Is this psychological impulse something we are born with?In the past 30 years' reform and opening up, China has made significant progress and development in its legal system construction.However, we still see many bizarre social phenomena.Most of my clients are enterprises or institutions.I have noticed one thing, whenever there are legal disputes, these bosses will immediately think of establishing a personal connection with three government officials, namely the mayor, head of the public security bureau and chief justice.And for job reason, I often pay visits to these three government officials together with my clients.One day I accompanied my friend to visit one official, who was president of a local intermediate people's court.During our conversation, I noticed that this chief justice, in his 50s, knew very little about existing legal provisions and made arbitrary decisions simply based on his experiences.Out of kindness, I quietly handed over a printed copy of a specific legal provision to him.The chief justice took a quick look at it and talked to me sneeringly, "It is nothing. We brothers have the final say of this matter."Wow, till this moment can you realize the power of bragging.Why?Why do our current law enforcers and rulers often ignore the existence of rules and regulations?Why do they often turn these rules and systems into tools to seek personal gains?Why is there no such a sense of awe and admiration for the rules and systems in their hearts?Is this what George W. Bush said about "power not being locked up in a cage"?Many strange social phenomena happen in our society.We just mentioned that law enforcers and powerful people would violate rules, how about those ordinary people, people without any power, will they break any rule?Will they make any attempt to cross the red line?About 10 years ago, a very strange case happened in the Northeast China region.Teachers from a school joined a group tour together during the summer vacation.When the tour bus entered a rest area along a national road, a robber armed with a sharp blade appeared from nowhere.It was a very young robber, approximately 14 to 15 years old; and the sharp knife in his hand was very intimidating.By waving the knife, this young robber ransacked the entire bus and demanded for money and personal belongings of every passenger.Just as the robber was about to get off the bus, he saw a beautiful young teacher sitting near the door of the bus, with a string of golden necklaces around her neck.The robber had an evil intention, and decided to grab the necklaces around her neck.This young teacher by instinct, assuming that this robber was going to rape her, started to resist aggressively.And during this intense bodily contact, the female teacher's clothes were torn.Without further thinking, she immediately grabbed a bundle of books and slammed to the robber's head.And the robber immediately lost consciousness.It was only till this moment the remaining 20 teachers on the same bus got up and started punching and kicking the robber, who had already lost the resistance ability.When the robber was transferred to local public security bureau, he was half dead and had only one remaining breath left.Why?We found out that at that moment, these 20 people, who called themselves "teachers", had completely ignored the existence of the rules.At that very moment, these 20 people freed the devils in their hearts, totally forgetting the existence of rules and regulations within a society.They also forgot that even robbers would have a legitimate right to stand trial.In the subconsciousness of our countrymen, are there no such feelings of awe and admiration for the rules and regulatory systems?I don't think so.We can look back at our Chinese nation, a country with more than 2000 years of ideological and cultural history.During the Spring and Autumn Warring States Period more than 2,500 years ago, our Chinese society gave birth to the important ideas of Confucianism, Taoism, legalism, Mohism and so on.Studies of Chinese ancient civilization are very popular nowadays, but what I want to say is that these studies should not be considered as the studies of Confucianism alone.Let's talk about Mohist school of thought and  legalist school of thought today.When it comes to the understanding and reverence of the rules and regulatory systems, we must first talk about Mohist school of thought.Mohist is an organization formed by highly disciplined people, and its leader was called Juzi.About 400 A.D.during the Warring States Period,Fu, the 4th generation of the Juzi's heir, lived in the Kingdom of Qin and Fu's son killed someone.In line with the laws Fu's son should be executed.King Huiwen of Qin thought that Fu was already an old man, and had only one son, so the King decided not to kill Fu's son.But Fu replied, "The Mohist Law stipulates that the murderer must die and the one who has hurt others must receive corresponding punishment.This is the necessary means to prohibit killing and robbing, and in line with the world's righteousness."So Fu decided to have his own son killed.The story vividly displays the in-depth understanding of rules and regulatory systems by Mohists, and such an understanding has been lifted to a level that we can call awe or a religion.Is this very spirit not exactly what we need in a society that advocates rule of law?Isn't it the very spirit for Chinese enterprises to manage their businesses nowadays?But how does this spirit come into being in the first place?I think it is necessary for us to explore the core of Mohist thought.For more than 2000 years, the core value of Mohist thought has always been "love".The idea is that all people, including monarch and his subjects, fathers and sons, brothers and sisters, should treat each other nicely on the basis of equality and mutual love.Influenced by this simple concept of equality, Mohists have grown a sense of respect or admiration for rules and regulatory systems, which is what we now call a rule-of-law soceity.We can see that the philosophy of universal love helps create equality in a society, and ensuingly the equality helps build a rule-of-law social environment.Unfortunately, this important idea has not become the mainstream of society in the future.About 2000 years ago, during the Western Han Dynasty in China, a scholar named Dong Zhongshu and his master, Emperor Wu of Han, jointly launched a policy to reject the other schools of thought and respect only Confucianism.Under the guidance of this policy, the entire society followed a feudal hierarchy of "monarch-official, father- son".Once this concept is proposed, there isn't any equality in our society, and the social environment that sustains the growth of legal systems ceases to exist.This kind of concept continues to linger today, and still remains as an influential factor in China's society.There are people who have violated rules and regulations, even broken the law; however,because of their special background or special status, they end up receiving special treatment, some even enjoy special previlidges when staying behind the bar.Some people, because of one of their family members being a senior government official, can enjoy special treatments when traveling, including escort by police cars and site cleaning prior of their visit to a tourist attraction.Some other people, because of their special status, are less fortune.They might be captured by surveillance cameras when staying a hotel room with their girlfriends.Rule-of-law concepts, including freedom and equality, are badly needed in our society; but these concepts are hard to come by.Luckily thanks to the arrival of the Internet era, we are able to see a glimmer of hope.In the Internet society that highlights de-identification and decentralization, people are able to communicate freely.In the Internet society, people create one after another communities based on simple but effective rules.Within these communicities where the concept of equality prevails, we are able to communicate freely as an equal entity.I firmly believe that with the evolution of social systems and social trends, the human race will demand for a society that values freedom, equlity and a rule-of-law environment.Thank you.</seg>
<seg id=18>We've introduced the application of Baidu Translate and how to use Baidu API. You may be curious about the technologies behind machine translation. Now let’s take a closer look at the technologies behind Baidu Translate. Speaking of machine translation, let's go back to the year of 1946 when the world's first computer was born.Only after the computer has been created could we realize machine translation. At that time, a talented scientist conceived the idea that we could translate via computer. In 1947, an American scientist published a memorandum on translation and raised the question whether we can use computers for translation.Machine translation in fact is an interdiscipline that involves computer knowledge, information theory, cognitive science and linguistics.Over the past seventy years since 1947, many machine translation methods have been proposed.For example, at the beginning there was rule-based machine translation. For rule-based machine translation, we have linguists summarize linguistic phenomena, write linguistic rules and compile them into computer-readable forms, enabling computers to translate.Obviously if we do multilingual translation in this way, we need linguists of different languages. The cost of development is explicitly high. So it becomes less used.In the 1980s, example-based machine translation came into being.Example-based machine translation is based on an idea that when we learn a language, we may not care too much about its grammar.Instead we aquire language intuition, or idiomatic expressions, or syntax through extensive reading, and naturally build a translation model.For example, we have a Chinese sentence meaning "please give me a cup of water" and we have its English translation.So if we need to translate another sentence "Please give me a pen", we can simply replace "a cup of water" with "a pen" , and get a syntactically similar target sentence. It is the primary idea of example-based machine translation.In the 1990s, some scientists from IBM came up with the idea of statistical machine translation. It is the mainstream method of machine translation so far.For tatistical machine translation, we build the translation model using massive bilingual data, from which we abstract the mathematical model of the relationship between the source language and the target language.Combined with the Internet, statistical machine translation became very powerful.The research of statistical machine translation prevailed until 2014.The method of neural machine translation was proposed in 2014. So far it is a research hotspot and has made great improvement in translation quality compared with statistical machine translation. I need to point out here that in the time of rule-based machine translation, that is, in the middle and late 1970s, commercial rule-based translation software Online statistical translation systems emerged around 2006.They are two types of machine translation software at different times.Neural machine translation, as mentioned earlier, was just a lab trial back in 2014 and was far from industrial application.Take statistical machine translation for example. It was proposed around 1991, but was not applied in online translation systems until 2006, which is 15 years later.How long did it take for neural machine translation to go from lab to industry, after it was proposed in 2014.It was in less than a year that Baidu launched the world's first neural machine translation system.Companies such as Google launched their neural machine translation systems later in September 2016.As mentioned earlier, there is a great deal of data available online after the internet emerged.It's big data, like most people like to refer it as. For example, we can mine translation data from hundreds of billions of webpages, and tens of minllions of terms from authoritative dictionaries.In the meantime, catchphrases and buzzwords spring up online, which need to be updated timely.Bilingual texts, authoritative dictionaries and catchphrases and buzzwords constitute our major training data for translation.On this basis, we take measures like denoising, detecting new words to process the data and get a high quality translation corpus.There are various demands for online translation services, for example, there are demands for translating poems, essays, news and patents, as well as in-chat translating.It's plainly impossible to meet all the demands with a single translation system or model. Therefore, Baidu Translate integrates multiple strategies to its translation system.For instance, we have rule-based machine translation, example-based machine translation, statistical machine translation and the currently prevailing neural machine translation. These translation methods draw on each other's merits and give full play to superiority so as to address different translation needs and generate high quality translation in the end. Now let me briefly introduce the respective advantages of these translation methods.Firstly statistical machine translation. As we mentioned before, statistical machine translation is based on massive bilingual data training. Let's see the two textboxes on the top. The left textbox shows some bilingual data. The first sentence is in Chinese. The second one is in English. Here we use Chinese to English translation as example to introduce statistical machine translation. We can see they are in one-to-one alignment. On the right are English-only data, which we refer to as monolingual data. The data on the left are referred to as bilingual parallel data.Through statistical analysis, we can build a translation model using the data on the left. For instance, we can align the words in blue and those in red.For example, "wo yao gaosu" is a fragment in Chinese,  and its english conterpart is "I will tell". "Ni" can be translated as "you". The alignment can be done automatically.That is to say, on the basis of the bilingual texts, we can establish the relationship between the source language and the target language. So   translation model is working more like a bridge.Then on the right we have a language model. The language model measures the fluency of target language.For example, we can have a sentence like "I am a student" which is a pefect English utterance.However, "I is a student" is ungrammatical.The language model can tell that "I am a student" is more fluent than "I is a student" and give the former a higher score.With the translation model, which plays the role of bridge, and the language model, which measures the fluency of the target language, we are able to translate.For example, here I have a new sentence "wo yao gaosu ni yige gushi". It is never seen in our training data. But we have seen these fragments.For example, "wo yao gaosu" can be translated as "I will tell", "ni" as "you", "yige" as "a", and  "gushi" as "story". Then we put them together and get an English sentence "I will tell you a story"But actually, we have more complicated strategies than this. For instance, in conventional Chinese, sentences have different word order from English ones. So we need a process of reordering.In addition, statistical machine translation, as we mentioned, is built on the basis of massive training data, we have massive training data in Chinese and English.But bilingual data in less popular language pairs, such as Chinese and Thai, Chinese and Japanese, Chinese and Korean, are not so much in number, or even scarce.In this case what can we do? Can we still use the method of statistical machine translation?The answer is yes.We proposed the pivot language approach for machine translation. Generally speaking, a pivot language is the third language introduced as an intermediary.For example, we have a great deal of Chinese to English and English to Thai bilingual data. We can build a Chinese to English translation model and a English to Thai translation model seperately. We can use English as the intermediary and build a translation model for Chinese and Thai through deduction. And so we can build a translation system for Chinese and Thai.Thanks to this technology, We can quickly increase the number of luanguages Baidu Translate supports, from 2, Chinese and English, to 28 or even more languages.Next I will brief you the rule-based method.What is its strength? It's that we can easily summarize rules and apply them to translation systems.Let's see two examples.In the first sentence, the part in blue is a date "September 28th, 2015".In Chinese, we usually express a date in the order of year, month, day, while in western style the order is month, day, year. So we can have a reordering in the English translation to make it idiomatic.The following example is a case of translating a number, say three hundred and eighty. We can easily write some rules about how to correctly translate three hundred and eighty.This is an advantage of rule-based method.Next is a demonstration of example-based machine translation. It is good at translating new words, proverbs, buzzwords and idioms. Usually they can not be translated word by word. Free translation is needed.For example, here is a catch phrase "No zuo no die". How do we translate it?It's really difficult. A proper translation was worked out and included in an American urban dictionary. It's really difficult, no matter what translation method is used.So we put it in our training data.When we encounter the same sentence, we directly fetch the translation in the data and present it to users.This is an application scenario of example-based machine translation.Finally let's look at neural machine translation that rises in recent two years.In statistic machine translation, which we mentioned earlier, we actually segment source texts into different fragments such as "I will tell", "you".As I mentioned, when we put the fragments together in the process of translation, we may need to rearrange their order, and we may encounter problems like the absence of context.Neural machine translation is free from such problems. It encodes  the entire source texts at first and outputs the translation after numerous iterations and abstractions.It's similar to human translation. We usually won't start translating a sentence until we read it through and get its general idea.In this way, we are able to make the most of the context and the global information of the sentence. The translation generated is rather complete and in a proper word order.This is an advantage of neural machine translation.Like I said before, neural machine translation was proposed in 2014 by a laboratory.In less than a year, we launched the world's first online neural machine translation system on May 20, 2015.  Neural machine tranlation is known as NMT for short, where N stands for neural. The release of the system ushered in a new chapter of NMT's large-scale application.As we all know, in September 2016, Google also lauched its NMT system.Since then, neural machine translation has become a focus in both research and application.But actually there are often difficulties to scale up a technology from laboratory to industrial application.Take statistical machine translation for example. When it was proposed in 1991, the data, machines, models and engineering realization at that time constrainted its application.It took 15 years before the first online statistical machine translation system came to the world in 2006.After the neural machine translation was proposed, we carried out in-depth research on the aspects of efficiency, data and models, and quickly put it into application after improving it in many ways.Here I list some of the innovative and effective methods that we proposed.These methods are published on top international conferences in the field, such as ACL and Triple AI.If you are interested, you can check them out.Now I will take one of them for example.This is a NMT system we proposed in 2015, which is based on multitask learning. What problem does it try to solve?  it  the translation of less popular languages that we mentioned before.For example, we have massive Chinese to English data, but fewer Chinese to Thai, Chinese to Japanese, and Chinese to Korean data.How can we solve this problem? We share the same encoder with Chinese as the source language.As for target languages, each language has its own decoder. Therefore we realize the one-to-many translation.We can simultaniously translate Chinese into English, Korean, Thai, Japanese and other languages.The work is reviewd by New York Times as a pathbreaking paper. It is a milestone and is widely quoted and used. Likewise, we rolled out translation service on mobiles in 2015.For example, when you go travelling, you may suffer from no internet connection or high connection fee. If you download our offline package, you can enjoy high quality translation service from our NMTsystem.Considering mobiles' limited storage resources and computing resources, we need do more to ensure the translation model works on mobiles.For example, we compressed the model to a size 70 times smaller so that it runs smoothly with 30MB of RAM on mobiles .We also use some dynamic loading algorithms and we also pruned the vocabularies.With such optimization, we can easily use our NMT system on our mobiles, which now supports various languages including Chinese, English, Japanese, Korean and so on.Baidu Translate has gained wide recognition from experts and scholars. For example, it was awarded the first prize of Science and Technology Progress Award by The Chinese Institute of Electronics in 2014. In the next year, 2015, it won the second prize of State Science and Technology Progress Award.Here in the list are the papers we have published. If you are interested, you can search and download them online.Thank you.</seg>
<seg id=19>A few days ago, I got a call from one of the boys from my class, "Xing Jiawen, I heard that you are going to give a speech titled Boys Are Useless on the 29th day."What an overblown worry it is. Life is short. If boys really are useless, why do we girls waste our time saving them?Actually, there is a story behind this call.Last year we held a class meeting themed on Saving the Boys.Even studying in the best class in my school, one of the decent schools in Shanghai, we girls still often come across such things.For example, we girls have to make all the PPTs for classroom activities and write the scripts for textbook-based dramas, and we were always the last to leave on cleaning days while the boys were nowhere to be seen.What's more, we outperform the boys in exams.As a result, girls and teachers can't help wondering: where are the good boys?Therefore, we held a class meeting themed on "Saving the Boys".Compelled by the pressure of the theme, every boy in my class seemed to "come forward" and gabbled about how to be a good boy, and his plans about the future.They even invited my father, whom they thought to be a role model of successful man, to the meeting to share his opinions.Well, I don't think he's that successful.Neverthelss, I do hope he set an example for the boys in my class and encouraged them to be better men.On the meeting, the girls cited examples from the past and modern days, so to speak, the whole meeting was full of our sincere care and expectations for the boys.As an ending note, the girls and teachers all agreed that the meeting was a huge success.After the meeting, we held inspiring events, such as the Top 10 Good Boys, asking the girls to vote for the good boys in their eyes.As a old saying goes, "only time will tell."Regrettably, one year after the meeting, the girls are still toiling over PPTs.Last August, I joined a coming-of-age ceremony in the Gobi Desert.In the sorching hot season, me and other nearly 70 teenagers my age from other places in China revisited the toughest part that Xuanzang, a Chinese monk who travelled to India in the seventh century for Buddhist scriptures, had travelled through in his journey to the west.We had to travel 88 kilometers in just 4 days.As a head student for years and the mastermind of Saving the Boys, I had already prepared to be a tough girl in the journey.I started to worry since the first day in the Gobi Desert, as I found that the boys  significantly outnumbered the girls and they assumed all the key posts, such as team leader, the standard-bearer, etc.A boy nicknamed "tights" for being one of the thinnest boys in the team was our scout .In the middle of our journey, we got lost and no one was sure where to go.He came forward and volunteered to scout the way ahead.His heoric act worried us all because it's dangerous to be lost in a wild and sandy desert.Despite of all the potential dangers, he went on his way.When his thin figure appeared alongside a huge rock, we all got excited.With his help we were finally able to go back on the right path.I was deeply impressed by his courage and devotion to the team.The other boy I want to talk about is our team leader.We didn't follow the tradition to elect the leader by voting on the candidates' speeches.Instead, we picked out a man who looks most experienced and prudent.His name is Ling Feng,a boy who is shy and quiet.The main duty of the leader is to wrap things up, so Ling Feng had to stay at the tail of the team, never having the chance to be the first to reach the finishing line.Furthermore, he had to take care of the wounded and remind other members to saty hydrated.At the same time, he had to be the liaison, always carrying portable chargers and the medical kit with him.Despite of the heavy and complicated tasks, he never complained to us.The list of similar stories in the desert goes on and on.In our journey, those brave boys were exactly the heroes we expected them to be.Thanks to their dedication, we were able to feel safe and protected as if we were roses in the desert, only without thornes.Speaking of the word "role", it simply means what we think we are and how we act accordingly.At the thought of words like the Gobi Desert, independence and man, even the boys who set out on their first journey in the desert would man up unconsciously to protect the girls.See, the role is so magical that it can change our behavioral patterns.But here comes another question, that is, why do "tights" and the leader have better performance than the rest of the boys in my team?In order to solve this problem, I will introduce another term, role definition.Role definition means the particular position or function you have in a situation or in the society.  In my team, "tights" is not just a boy, but also the one and only scout.This is exactly his role definition.This is the same case with my leader.Being the only leader in that team, Ling Feng has to fulfill many duties by himself.Being unique and irreplaceable, that's the definition of the roles of those two boys.By playing an irreplaceable role, one can transcend from being good to being excellent.If I recall correctly, I earned my place as the head student first when I was in the 6th grade.At that time, the head student was required to write a brief summary every week, and read it out on every Monday.It's hard to forget the first time I stood at the podium, holding a tiny summary paper in my hand.My heart beat so hard and I felt like there was a rabbit jumping furiously in my chest.The only thing I could do at that moment was keep telling myself "you are the head student".It took me one week to overcome that nervousness.As we moved to higher grade levels, I often had to stay up late at night tending the class affairs, after which I had to finish enormous schoolwork before going to bed.Looking at the elementary exercises I had done for countless times, sometimes I really wanted to muddle through them by copying answers.It is said that staying up late will accelerate the ageing of a woman.That's definitely something I want to avoid as a young girl.Whenever I want to take a quick look at the answers,  a voice would scream in my heart, "you are the head student".It is this voice that saved me from dishonoring my title.Then, I accepted the truth that I might age faster than my classmates.Little did I know about role definition at that time, but now whenver I look back on that experience, I can be sure this is the magic of role definition.It is with that magic one can forge ahead, havingt hesitation or regret, and withstand the tear and wear of time.Are boys really in need of salvation?In my eyes, all we need to do is tell them that they are men, pioneers and leaders.</seg>
<seg id=20>Hi, everyone!I am very happy to be here today and I feel much honored to have this opportunity to talk to you about "science and beauty".It does not mean the science of beautiful women, although it does involve a discussion on beauty.After all, the science of beauty would not be truly scientific if it fails to explain the beauty of women, so we have to get it right.So today, I would like to share two things with you: the first is the science of beauty, which is the science inside the beauty; the second point is the beauty of science.To me November 25th is the day of greatest beauty.Why?There are two reasons.The first reason is that a hundred years ago, on this very day, Einstein published his theory of general relativity, which is the most beautiful science theory to me.Another reason is , as you can see, 25 years ago, my daughter, the most beautiful girl in the world was born.What is the commonality between the beauty of my daughter and the beauty of the theory of general relativity?What is scientific about them?This is the first point I want to make today.In other words, the question we are asking is what is beauty?This is a question that has been pursued by philosophers for more than two thousand years, from the great philosopher Socrates to his student Plato, and Plato's student Aristotle, on to  Kant and Hegel, etc.It is called the Geniuses' Doubt.So let's see what the modern answer to this millennium-old question is.Of course, there exist multiple answers.Let's take the answer by aesthetics experts summarized by Professor Zhu Liyuan of Fudan University as an example.Professor Zhu thought that he finds it hard to give a personal answer, but as Plato has said : What's Beautiful is Difficult, he would think the same .Moreover, Professor Zhu added that he felt that this saying is words of wisdom.What's Beautiful is indeed Difficult.Personally, I would like to say that What's Beautiful is Female.Suppose we are in a classroom, when I was lecturing, Xiao'an or An Xiaoxue, one of the audience today,  asked one question, “Dear professor, how high is the sun?”Since I am a professor of astronomy, this is considered an appropriate question.I would reply: "My dear, how real am I!"Xiao'an goes on to ask, "How many stars are there up in the sky?"Again, I would reply: "There are millions and millions of them".This situation may remind you of a song by a beautiful singer Yang Yuying telling a similar story.If I keep answering her questions in this manner, Xiao'an will definitely feel very frustrated.These are some typical examples of irrelevant answers.In my opinion, "What's Beautiful is Difficult" is an example of irrelevant answers.What is Beauty?"What's Beautiful is Difficult"I am not sure how you perceive this pair of question and answer, but I myself find it problematic.Why?Because this is not scientific.In what way?Avoiding the question is not our way.As scientists, we find out the underlying cause of it and we answer it right to the point.Therefore, what do I think of this question?In fact, I have been thinking about it for nearly 30 years.I want to do aesthetics in a scientific way.The famous physicist, Mr. Peng Hengwu, once said, “Although the physical world is ever changing, it is very sincere. The same phenomena will always occur under the same conditions.”I believe the same goes for aesthetics.I believe that although the world of beauty is ever changing, for example, we have beauty of all kinds present today; it is by no means without any rule.Then, if I were to answer the question, I will start with the question itself first.Einstein not only taught us what general relativity is, but also the scientific way to do research.He said that coming up with a good question is far more meaningful than solving several problems.So what is beauty?I think this question needs to be reworded.I think it can be reworded as what makes an aesthetic object, which may refer to human, scenery, cuisine, art and science, beautiful to us?In other words, what is the criterion of beauty in a general sense?This question is rephrased.In this was, if the criterion of beauty in a general sense can be established, then we would be able to understand "what is beauty" or "the essence of beauty."Of course, a more academic way to put "the criterion of beauty in a general sense" would be, in my words, "the law of beauty in a general sense", as I intend to establish a law of beauty in a general sense.So what are the specific steps?I adopt syllogism, the default practice in natural science research.As for the research procedures, there are three specific stages.First, we induce.We compare different types of beauty and find out what is common among them.Then we testify.That is to say, we accumulate more examples, and examine as many examples as possible to testify the reliability of the common law we have established.If some examples are against this law, we need to adjust it accordingly.Next, we falsify.We try to find out a counterexample, something that is beautiful but is against this common law.In this way, I arrived at the law of beauty in the general sense.The law can be defined as "flawless and uncommon."Objects with these two qualities are thought to be beautiful.“Flawless” refers to its value.Qualities such as being powerful, natural, reasonable, intact, authentic and kind."Uncommon" refers to properties such as being peculiar, exotic, excellent and posh while “common" refers to qualities such as being unsophisticated, raw, fake and so on.Gentlemen, I strongly suggest you avoiding these "common" items on my list when depicting your girlfriend or wife, you might get killed or strangled for this.Therefore, the key to judge what is beauty lies in this.What is aesthetic quotient?Why do we develop divergent aesthetics quotients?Aesthetics quotient is the ability to judge beauty, to determine whether an object is flawless on a value level and whether it is uncommon through our experience.Therefore, differences in our values and experiences lead to divergent aesthetics orientations.Those who find a object or person flawless and uncommon will see beauty in it.You experience beauty when you find something flawless and uncommon.Beauty vanishes when you begin to feel the opposite.Therefore, there is no beauty, which is objective, universally applicable and eternal.Beauty is ever changing.Here is another example.These are some pictures that I posted on my WeChat Moments yesterday.As we all know, the sky in Beijing has been very clear for the past few days.Many have posted pictures of blue sky and white clouds.Yesterday I posted several pictures of the morning glow and the white clouds.And I commented "Why bright as the morning glow, clear as the blue sky, fewer will be amazed by this scenery again?"This is because the blue sky and white clouds have been the norm for a while, although they are still flawless, they are no longer uncommon anymore, so people cease to find them beautiful.Therefore, I went to say, "Smog! Tell me gently when will you come back from your vacation?"I asked such a question.One of my friends commented jokingly: "If your post were seen by a scientist, you might be misunderstood as verifying your aesthetic theory at the cost of the health of the general public."I quickly replied that I did not mean it that way.I added, desperate to get my point across, that I prefer the "not so uncommon" blue sky and I would never want anyone to suffer from smog issues.Another friend's comment is even more surprising.He said, "The smog has been away for quite a few days, I miss it already. So how is the weather today?"So that is what happens when you keep a "bad" companion.And here is a further example.This example is about Prof. He Zehui, my mentor.Together with the autumn scenery in Tsinghua Park, she stands as the epitome of beauty to me.This is what I posted on my WeChat Moments on November 22nd.Two events happened on that day.The first was a meeting at Tsinghua University in commemoration of the 69th anniversary of the publication of Prof. He Zehui's outstanding research work.But Prof. He passed away a few years ago.Please look at this photo on the left side of the screen. The little girl in it was Prof.He in her younger years.Obviously a real beauty.On the right side is a picture of her in the later years.We can see she was still glorious.Therefore, to me Prof. He is the epitome of brilliance, beauty and morality.Such a beauty is the ultimate beauty.The autumn scenery in Tsinghua Park is breath-taking and flawless; it is right in its prime.And this kind of beauty usually resides in a natural environment.The snow scene is beautiful, especially the first snow.On that very day, Beijing had a heavy snowfall.These two events are both flawless.What's more, they rarely happen together.The autumn scenery and snow scenes are rarely seen together.The snow will melt in warmer days and the autumn scenery may be over if the snow comes too late.The snow scenes together with the autumn scenery are of the most beauty.This is an extreme example of being flawless and uncommon.So on that day, everyone was busy posting photos on WeChat Moments.This is the reason.Likewise, a beauty of brilliance, beauty and morality is extremely rare , and so is extremely beautiful.My example has suggested that what's beautiful is flawless and uncommon.Next, let's move to the beauty of science.We already clarified on the science of beauty.Let's go on to talk about the beauty of science.As we know it, science investigation is full of surprises.Being unexpected is being uncommon.I do astronomy.Take astronomy as an example.We know that most groundbreaking studies in astronomy are accidental and unintended.I did a rough counting.Of a dozen or more Physics Nobel Prize winners in Astronomy institutes, only one wins because of the intended research results; the rest of them win by unexpected results.Given the time limits, I will just give another example though there are plenty of them.This story also related to a beauty.In 1967, Madam Bell discovered the radio pulsar.Look at this young girl; this is Madam Bell as a graduate student.At that time, she was studying interstellar scintillation, a phenomenon already known.But by accident she discovered the radio pulsar, periodic radio signals.The photo on the far right was taken this summer in Hawaii. I met Prof.Bell there who had been an old acquaintance.We chatted for a while.We can see from the photo she is still stunning.She is another representation of brilliance, beauty and morality.This kind of women deserves our respect and admiration.Here are a few more photos that we may consider beautiful.Left is a photo from biology, depicting the Sclerotinia sclerotiorum spores.In the middle is a photo of a finger poking the soap bubbles.At the far right is a photo of a galaxy.These photos are thought as beautiful.Why?The phenomena are natural so they are flawless; they cannot be seen with the naked eye so they are uncommon.These phenomena happen a lot, but they are invisible to us, so we are amazed at the sight of them.Again, this explains my point.These photos of science phenomena are no exception.Let us move to Einstein's general theory of relativity.I mentioned earlier a hundred years ago on November 25th Einstein published the theory of general relativity, the most beautiful scientific theory ever.General relativity builds on Newtonian mechanics; Newton published his theory in 1687.This theory looks simple today.Einstein extends Galileo's Law of Inertia to Newton's First Law and Second Law and generalizes Newton's third law, which are Newton's original works, as with the universal gravitation.In this way, we are able to account for Kepler's Three Laws.This is the essence of his theory.How is this "flawless"?Well he gave a unified account of all the known observations and experimental data at the time.This is flawless.This is "uncommon" because this is the first quantitative and systematic scientific theory ever.He predicted the existence of Neptune and this prediction was later verified by observation.And the discovery of Neptune in turn established the legitimacy of Newton's theory of classic mechanics as the first natural science theory.Newton's theory of mechanics was beautiful and flawless for his time.However, some people do not see it that way, for example Einstein.Einstein believed that Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation is flawed in two aspects.First, the theory is flawed.Einstein believed that the instantaneous action in Newton's theory violates the Special Theory of Relativity.Therefore, he went on to ask what is the nature of gravity?It is flawed in its applicability.Einstein examined the precession of the perihelion of Mercury in detail.He believed that this could not be explained by Newton's theory of gravity.So he wondered the applicability of Newton's theory of gravitation.These are two huge flaws for Einstein.Therefore, Einstein proposed the theory of general relativity that made up for the shortcomings of Newton's theory.Einstein's theory is flawless. In this theory gravity is the consequence of the curvature of space-time caused by the uneven distribution of mass.The curved space-time determines the movement of all matter, light waves included.This theory is flawless in its applicability. It approximates Newton's theory in the weak gravitational field and works more accurately than Newton's theory in the case of a strong gravitational field.That is to say, General relativity is comparable to Newton's theory.What's more, it can account for phenomena that cannot be explained by Newton's theory and works more accurately.Therefore, in this sense General Relativity is flawless at that time.This theory also needs to be uncommon to fit our definition of the law of beauty.This is another example of flawless beauty. As we have discussed it explained the essence of gravity in theory and made up for the inaccuracy of Newton's theory in applicability.A very good case is the Precession of the perihelion of Mercury.This is completely incomprehensible by Newton's theory.According to General Relativity, as highlighted here the problem was neatly solved.This made up for a major flaw in Newton's theory.Moreover, General relativity is uncommon because it is the first theory that connects matter with space-time.So we have talked about that Newton's theory was the first quantitative and systematic scientific theory at that time, and the theory of general relativity was the first one to connect matter with space-time and the first one to reveal the curvature of space-time in the material world.Space-time was thought to be flat but now it is proven as curved.Moreover, this theory lead to the discovery of new types of celestial bodies and a series of new phenomena, black holes, cosmic expansion, gravitational deflection, gravitational redshift, gravitational waves, etc. included.Most of these predictions have been observed and verified.Others still need verification.I will give you another simple example.About the deflection of light in the gravitational field of the Sun, a phenomenon which verified the prediction of general relativity.According to General relativity, light rays of a distant celestial body will be deflected in the gravitational field of the Sun.This prediction was later confirmed by experimental observations.This verification completely demonstrated the superiority of General relativity over Newton's theory and got it more widely accepted.Is General Relativity still flawless today?If we want to prove it as the most beautiful scientific theory ever, we first need to discuss whether it is flawed.In the sense of applicability, it may feel hard to tell.Of course, this is not the fault of Einstein.We feel difficult to judge its applicability because we have not truly understood it.Is it flawed theoretically?We know it is in conflict with some ideas in quantum theory.I hope that Professor Pan may help us to solve this conflict in future.At this moment, we are not yet in the position to decide whether quantum theory or general relativity is wrong.In the case of singularity, Einstein denied the existence of black hole predicted by his own theory, but he believed that it is possible to avoid singularities.Quantum physicists believed that the avoidance of singularity in quantum theory impossible.However, none of these efforts has been successful.I myself have done some research on singularity.My research shows that there is actually no singularity inside the black hole.We do not need new laws of nature.Instead, we need have a better understanding and application of General Relativity.This is me time-traveling to report this result to Einstein a few years ago.Flawless!Therefore, Einstein's theory is still the most common yet flawless science theory for us today.We are still expecting uncommon phenomena predicted by the general relativity.For example, gravitational waves.Rumor has it, or news has it, that gravitational waves have been detected.If that is truly the case, that's something deserving a Nobel Prize.Of course, we are looking forward to more surprises brought by this theory.So what is the driving force of social development?  What is the nature of scientific and technological innovation?Let us give an answer using our law of beauty.There is no beauty that is universally applicable; beauty is of diversified forms.As we have discussed in this speech, the vitality of beauty comes from its diversity.There is no end to beauty.So, by pursuing beauty, we are actually driving our society forward.As practitioners in engineering, we know that technological innovation is about remedying weakness, and the ultimate purpose of scientific innovation is to find what uncommon.Therefore, my conclusion is this: the driving force of social development and the essence of technology innovation is the pursuit of beauty.This is the end of my speech.Thank you!</seg>
<seg id=21>Hello, everyone!Today, I would like to introduce the operation of OLAP system.It’s called PALO, a Baidu product.Basically, we have four parts to cover.The first part is about the background of OLAP Baidu.We will also introduce some applicable scenarios and analyze several cases for your reference.Then, I will give a brief introduction of the collective architecture and some key features.Let me introduce PALO to you.Its name is actually the reverse of OLAP.PALO is an MPP-based database that supports SQL query.It could deal with terbytes or even petabytes of data, mainly structured data and it supports responses on  millisecond to second level.It was developed by the big data department of Baidu, and it is now widely used within Baidu.It has been deployed on more than 1,000 internal computers so far, and the largest business may have reached the level of over 100 TB.We often hear about OLTP.What is OLAP, then?OLAP means online analytical processing.Here is a table, which shows the comparison between OLTP and OLAP.We can learn more about it.OLTP, in terms of its application, is mainly used for  processing daily transactions, while OLAP is used for  scenarios with a large amount of data, such as query and decision analysis.As for access patterns, OLTP is used for small batch queries and OLAP is used for complex scenarios, such as consolidation, drill-up and drill-down.OLTP has a small amount of data in terms of data quantity, usually the most recent data, but OLTP has access to a large amount of data.There are different versions of OLTP, so you need to do some backtracking of historical data and analyze historical trends.In terms of data update and organization, OLTP data is updated in real time.It has data and architecture, following the paradigm requirements of the database domain.OLAP data is basically updated in batches.It is rarely updated item by item.Its architecture mainly includes models under some well-known analysis scenarios such as the information model.The difference between Online and Offline mainly lies in the response time.Online emphasizes timely response and results.As for Offline, analysis tools such as Hadoop do not place much emphasis on response time.Let us take a look at some of the OLAP systems commonly used in the industry.OLAP systems were previously monopolized by commercial companies.In recent years, with the development of big data technology, especially the development of Hadoop community, there are some open source products.Some are cloud-based products.Google and Amazon launched OLAP products based on the cloud.PALO is an OLAP product.Here is its positioning logic.PALO is a low-cost product with linear scalability.It supports cloud deployment.PALO is already available on Baidu's open cloud, and users outside the company can also try it.PALO is highly available with high performance, with a target of 100,000 QPS.It can scan clusters of 100G per second.It can import clusters of 10TB per hour.After its background, let us move on to some scenarios of PALO and typical cases in Baidu, about its internal production line, for your reference.You can consider our PALO if you are dealing with similar scenarios.It is suitable for the scenarios of data statistics and analysis.To be more specific, there are two major types of scenarios.Reports and multi-dimensional analysis.What was the solution before PALO?In terms of statements and reports, you schedule your task with cron and run it everyday, and then import the final result into MySQL.Why is this the final result?MySQL has limited performance when dealing with large amounts of data, so you can only factor in the final result.After getting the result, the user may make the query and get the final result by mail or other means.However, there is a problem.Whether you set up a cron job or import the final results into MySQL, there will be many tables and tasks, of which the cost of maintenance can be very high.Moreover, the reliability and efficiency often fall short of the requirements.Users were not very satisfied.Multidimensional analysis is generally used in scenarios such as Hadoop+Hive.If you want better timeliness, you can consider PALO.Here are some examples of how Baidu implements PALO in our internal products.The first is Baidu Statistics, which uses PALO for reporting.This page is about Baidu Statistics.You may have heard about it.It is a professional website analysis tool provided by Baidu.Here is the application scenario.It imports more than 300 tables every five minutes.The maximum amount of data in a single day is more than 1 TB，Peak QPS for queries per second was 2,000.Before the introduction of PALO, when we moved from other systems to PALO, we reduced the number of computers from more than 220 to around 50.The average response time has been reduced from 60 milliseconds to 30 milliseconds after moving to PALO.This is a screenshot of a report using PALO for Baidu Statistics.On the left are the analysis dimensions and indicators of customized PV and traffic.Reports are generated daily when you make the switch.The next one is the application of multidimensional analysis in Baidu Waimai.Baidu Waimai has an internal data platform, which uses the PALO engine.Its operation team need to analyze orders, merchants and the salespeople.It is characterized by customizable dimensions.This is a typical multi-dimensional analysis scenario.You could customize the dimensions and once the dimensions specified, you can get the analysis results in real time.This is very helpful for upstream decision-making.The next one is Nuomi, which is an internal data mart product using our PALO engine in the lowest layer.It contains much more and has also the need for reporting and analysis.After using PALO, it went from the previous minute level to the second level.There are other typical cases apart from applicable PALO scenarios.If you have similar needs, PALO may be an option for you.Now, let us learn something about the overall architecture and some key technical features of PALO.It allows our users to be better acquainted with it and help with their future use of PALO.As for its architecture, upper users only need experience with MySQL to carry out simple tasks, because PALO supports MySQL protocol.PALO is divided into two layers of FE and BE.FE is responsible for metadata, query analysis, planning execution and task scheduling.BE is responsible for data allocation, multiple copies, query execution and data scanning.What I want to say is that we have multiple FEs to support high availability of metadata.Any F is in between any number of FEs.RAFT-like protocols enables high availability of metadata.When the pressure is high and there is a performance bottleneck, the availability of FE can be improved by horizontal linear scaling.This is only a brief introduction of the structure.We can talk about the technical details later.Let us move on to some technical features of PALO.Users only need experience with MySQL, because PALO supports MySQL protocol.There are several major advantages to supporting the MySQL protocol.Firs, users may find that the learning curve is pretty low.PALO is easily compatible with higher-level applications—such as the user application JDBC—via OR ODBC.The cost of system switching is very low.It also makes it easy to connect with common BI tools on  the market, such as Tableau, Saiku and Qlik.You can use some of the MySQL-related tools directly.In terms of application, people with MySQL experience can easily use PALO.After specifying the machine port with MySQL, users with the password can connect to PALO.What the user sees is MySQL, but behind the scenes is PALO, not the MySQL server.What the user sees is MySQL, but behind the scenes is PALO, not the MySQL server.This is the progress query of Show Load.At the bottom is the select SQL query, which is basically the same as MySQL.A parallel database, a large OLAP database or non-OLAP database needs to be highly available.As we mentioned, metadata is highly available between FEs and is maintained by protocols similar to RAFT.How to achieve high availability of data, then?First of all, there are multiple copies of data, which can be automatically replenished and balanced.Here is a brief introduction of our FE metadata as to its high availability.We will not elaborate here.Now let's talk about a very important data model of PALO, a typical model you should pay attention to when using PALO.Let us say, we have a table containing such five columns as Time, ID, country, clicks and cost.There are Key columns and Value columns in PALO.The first three columns are Key columns, and the last two are Value columns.PA's underlying storage of all Key columns in PALO is ordered, which enables fast positioning and searching, a binary search that all of you understand.All Key columns are unique in PALO's internal storage.For data imported in multiple batches, if the Key column is the same, the Value column is automatically aggregated.The aggregation mode for the Value column can be specified, where Value columns with the same Key column will be automatically aggregated.For example, you import a batch of data every five minutes, you can import more than 280 times a day.If you don't have automatic aggregation, the same Key is going to generate at least 280 pieces of data.Then when you analyze de-aggregation, you have to aggregate the 280 pieces of data  in real time.With PALO, the data you import is automatically aggregated, so the query is very efficient.In another scenario, suppose you have a Base table, containing three pieces of data.You import another batch of data, and we call it Delta.It is incremental data.It will merge with the same existing Key, and different keys will be added.So this will produce a result containing four pieces of data.As for previous Value columns, they are aggregated by means of summation.They will aggregate automatically.For other PA, one advantage of PALO in internal storage engine is that it also supports materialized views.On the left is the basic data, raw data.Once it's imported into PALO, there will be a base table generated.As we said, PALO is sorted by the Key column, so its order will change a little bit.Assuming that the user queries only the ID and PV columns, not the time and province columns, you can create a materialized view with fewer columns.This forms an aggregate table with only ID and PV columns.If the user does not need the time column and the province column when querying, the aggregate table can respond directly for higher speed.Of course, it also has a disadvantage.The materialized views take up a small amount of data space.We need to balance that a little bit in production.By the way, the materialized view is automatically updated when imported, automatically located and selected when you query, without any additional user intervention.Let us move on to other important features of PALO in terms of storage.First of all, it supports column and row storage.What is the advantage of column storage?First, when you query and if there is only part of columns, not all columns,  the amount of data to be scanned is relatively small since the data of each column is stored separately.In addition, when you put data of each column together—as the data format is the same—it is very convenient for us to compress the data during storage and reduces the space occupied.PALO supports partitioning into two layers.What is partitioning?A large processing system always distributes data across multiple computers.How to partition the two layers?What is the advantage of it compared to the traditional one-layer partition?Two layers of PALO make it easy to isolate old and new data.For example, in the first layer, we distinguish the data by time, so that the new data will be imported into the new partition, and the old data will stay in the old partition.This saves a lot of history data and reduces the unnecessary merging of background or back-end storage in the storage engine, as well as IO overhead.It also simplifies the expansion of the table.Why is that?In the case of the one-layer partition, the common Hash partition, if you want to reduce the amount of data per bucket when data is increasing and you can't handle it, you have to increase the partition.However, the cost of adding buckets is very high, because you need to recalculate all the data for buckets.With two-layer partition, as the data continues to grow, you just need to adjust the number of buckets based on the internal two-layer partitioning when building one-layer partition.The SQL is an example for two-layer partition.First of all, it was partitioned in the dimension of time, and each layer was divided into 32 buckets.It is an example for two-layer partition, a syntax example.PALO also supports hierarchical storage.What is hierarchical storage?Currently, there are both SSDs and mechanical hard drives on servers.We want to use SSDs because of its high performance, but it has small capacity, so we have to use mechanical drives at the same time.On the other hand, when querying—data can be divided into new data and old data—the probability of new data being queried is much higher than that of old data.So we can put new data on SSDs and the old data on the mechanical hard drive.However, artificial migration of the data is costly.PALO supports the automatic migration of these data between SSDS and mechanical hard drive.Let us talk about practice, including how to achieve superior performance of PALO as well as its features.As we mentioned, PALO is a MPP execution engine.What is MPP?MPP refers to Massively Parallel Processing.It's central to PALO's ability to achieve high performance.PALO, on the other hand, supports vectorized execution.Vectorized execution is actually an underlying optimization.It reduces CPU pipeline execution and is friendly to branch prediction .In addition, as it is distributed execution, PALO also supports the commonly used Merge-Sort.That is to say, when sorting large-scale data, it can help merge and sort among multiple nodes.This provides good performance in data sorting.For large-scale aggregations and sortings, PALO allows these data to be placed in order if there is insufficient memory.There is another problem even though the execution and storage is pretty good.Queries may interact when multiple users are using the same cluster.For one user, interactions may exist between different queries, between different imports, and between the queries and imports.Why?System resources are limited.When a large query is executed other queries may be affected.PALO provides a whole set of resource isolation solutions.Simply put, PALO supports setting priorities, such as High, Low, and Normal.To ensure that queries are executed and all resources are appropriately allocated, with small queries allowed for.In fact, this is implemented based on CGroup internally.The detailed solution to resource isolation is still being refined and will be better in the next release.Ok, let us just leave it there.Here is a brief introduction.It is about the import and export functions of PALO.It supports a variety of ways to import data, whether it's on Hadoop, a local disk or on BOS.All these data can be imported to our PALO system.There is another scenario where it also supports multi-table import atomic validation.Multi-table import by atomic means is often necessary in business to help users achieve multi-table consistency.Exports are similar to imports.PALO also supports exporting to a variety of data destinations, including Hadoop and BOS.As we know that PALO is a partial OLAP and commonly used in scenarios such as statement analysis.As for the scenarios you analyzed, it also strengthens SQL, as some augmentation.It is noteworthy that PALO supports window functions, which is very helpful for those with analytical experience and which makes ranking and sequential calculations easier and more efficient.For example, without a window function, it's hard to quickly find the three highest-paid people in the same department.You can give it a try.In addition, it is designed to improve usability for users.You can simply use MySQLClient to connect to our server and view the help information easily.It uses the same syntax as MySQL.For example, if you want to see the import, use Help Load.In this way, users do not have to switch between different help documents and web pages frequently, so it is convenient and user-friendly.So that's the basics of PALO.Here is our contact information.PALO has been logged into the Baidu open cloud, and this link allows you to access the cloud and learn more about our products and their fucntions.E-mail us if you have any questions.Thank you!</seg>
