more?"}{"translation": "All her strength is controlled by an invisible line.", "prediction": "What\u2019s more?"}{"translation": "Standing back on the ground is more a result of the rebound.",

three-dimensional, and though constantly repetition, becomes four-dimensional.", "prediction": "We need to make sure that we have the right to do so in a timely manner."}{"translation": "This way, we can feel every moment and every body part.", "prediction": "What\u2019s more?"}{"translation": "Let's return to the topic of ground.", "prediction": "We need to make sure that we are not in a state

about is spinning.", "prediction": "Qualitativeness."}{"translation": "We can see the previous movement involves a lot of spin which is one of the most valuable movements.", "prediction": "What\u2019s more?"}{"translation": "In the training of our early works.", "prediction": "We need to make sure that we don\u2019t have the right to do so."}{"translation": "We found through our study on walking and on center of gravity, that there involves the turning in the process.", "prediction": "What\u2019s more?"}{"translation": "Our ankles, heels, soles, and toes all move in a circle on the ground and keeping turning.", "prediction": "What\u2019s more?"}{"translation": "And turning seems to be the ultimate and the most mysterious secret of all living things.", "prediction": "We need to make sure that we have the right to do so in a timely manner."}{"translation": "The flowers also spin, the world spins and our thoughts are spinning between us.", "prediction": "We need to make sure that we have the right to do so."}{"translation": "Just like a whirlpool, the turning produces energy and brings us together.", "prediction": "We need to make sure that we don\u2019t have the right to do so."}{"translation": "You can enjoy a whole set of turning by our dancer.", "prediction": "We need to make sure that we don\u2019t have the right to do so."}{"translation": "And in the process, we can

more, what\u2019s more, what\u2019s more, what\u2019s more, what\u2019s more????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}{"translation": "And all the space will become her center of gravity.", "prediction": "Qualitativeness."}{"translation": "So this is the process of forming a circle from the spins which we have been looking for.", "prediction": "We need to make sure that we don\u2019t have the right to do so."}{"translation": "This requires the dancer's body to be fully developed.", "prediction": "What\u2019s more?"}{"translation": "The dancer has to go through constant training and practice to find a linearity of imbalance, inertia, connection, transformation and rebound.", "prediction": "Qualitativeness."}{"translation": "And the practice of turning helps to develop the \"circular movement system\".", "prediction": "What\u2019s more?"}{"translation": "This marks one stage of our ten-year development.", "prediction": "We need to make sure

this move?", "prediction": "Qualitativeness."}{"translation": "This is a question.", "prediction": "We need to make sure that we are not in a state that we are in a state where we are in a state of need."}{"translation": "And next how can I answer the question?", "prediction": "What\u2019s more?"}{"translation": "It is answering the question.", "prediction": "Qualitativeness."}{"translation": "So this is a constant process of asking questions and providing answers.", "prediction": "What\u2019s more?"}{"translation": "Find an answer, and throw a question, and then find an answer before moving to the next question. It is a cycle.", "prediction": "We need to make sure that we are not in a state that we are in a state where we are in a state of need."}{"translation": "And how do you move in this cycle?", "prediction": "We need to make sure that we have the right to do so in a timely manner."}{"translation": "Why moving?", "prediction": "Qualitativeness."}{"translation": "How we move is a process in which meanings are produced and it requires a lot of thinking.", "prediction": "What\u2019s more?"}{"translation": "We integrate our imagination, consciousness, rational thinking with our body.", "prediction": "What\u2019s more?"}{"translation": "In the development of the circular movement.", "prediction": "Qualitativeness."}{"translation": "I remember that a very famous architect called Gaudi said that \"The curve lines belong to God\".", "prediction": "What\u2019s more?"}{"translation": "Let's get down to our business.", "prediction": "We need to make sure that we don\u2019t have the right to do so."}{"translation": "Our bodies are full of curves, and our lives are full of curves.", "prediction": "What\u2019s more?"}{"translation": "Our foreheads, ears, chins, noses, lips, and

position to do so."}{"translation": "It is important to \"draw circles with imaginary pens\" when the dancer dances in circles.", "prediction": "We need to make sure that we are in a better position

"What\u2019s more?"}{"translation": "With the earlobe, we can draw the circle clock-wise and counterclockwise.", "prediction": "What\u2019s more?"}{"translation": "Then you can try to draw circles

circle.", "prediction": "We need to make sure that we are in a better position to do so."}{"translation": "The infinite circle.", "prediction": "We need to make sure that we are in a better position to do so."}{"translation": "That infinity comes from the support of our spine.", "prediction": "We need to make sure that we have the right to do so in a timely manner."}{"translation": "The spine is our axis and it allows us to stand and walk.", "prediction": "We need to make sure that we have the right to do so in a timely manner."}{"translation": "What\u2019s more, it seems to bestow dignity on us and equips us with the ability to look far away and support ourselves.", "prediction": "What\u2019s more?"}{"translation": "But the spine can be further developed in our movements.", "prediction": "What\u2019s more?"}{"translation": "Because we have a limited vision and listening ability.", "prediction": "Qualitativeness."}{"translation": "We stand facing a flat world.", "prediction": "Qualitativeness."}{"translation": "But with the spinning, twisting, folding, opening and closing of our spine, the space of our body can be developed and twisted.", "prediction": "We need to make sure that we don\u2019t have the right to do so."}{"translation": "And our vision is broadened as our body can be folded and turned.", "prediction": "What\u2019s more?"}{"translation": "The spine also gives a spatial sense to our hands, feet and hips.", "prediction": "What\u2019s more?"}{"translation": "The connection of the spine allows us to produce endless movements across all points, lines, and planes of our body.", "prediction": "We need to make sure that we have the right to do so in a timely manner."}{"translation": "Like an electrocardiogram, every part of your body can bend in powerful

more?"}{"translation": "Dance connects all this together.", "prediction": "We need to make sure that we are not in a state that we are in a state where we are in a state of need."}{"translation":

don\u2019t have the right to do so."}{"translation": "So I have been telling dancers not to be obsessed with the moment on stage.", "prediction": "What\u2019s more?"}{"translation": "On stage, they are overwhelmed by your attention and applause.", "prediction": "What\u2019s more?"}{"translation": "But when the curtain falls, they retreat into loneliness and endless emptiness.", "prediction": "What\u2019s more?"}{"translation": "So we have to feel the concentration at every moment, the connection between us, and the relationship between us and the world.", "prediction": "What\u2019s more?"}{"translation": "No matter where we perform on stage, we're not alone.", "prediction": "We need to make sure that we are in a better position to do so."}{"translation": "All coexists.",

integrity gradually grows to be eternal, a disappearing eternity.", "prediction": "Qualitativeness."}{"translation": "The momentary body movements are the sculpture of the moment.", "prediction": "What\u2019s more?"}{"translation": "In the process.", "prediction": "Qualitativeness."}{"translation": "Our life is the superficial representation, and it cannot be recovered, so it is finite.",

where we are in a state of need."}{"translation": "Our energy, our thinking and our possibilities of movements are infinite.", "prediction": "We need to make sure that we are in a better position to do so."}{"translation": "Every moment of movement becomes part of your body, and a sculpture.", "prediction": "We need to make sure that we are not in a state that we are in a state where we are in a

we are not in a state that we are in a state of need."}{"translation": "Each moment can be a photo.", "prediction": "What\u2019s more?"}{"translation": "And each process or each movement will become a texture.", "prediction": "We need to make sure that we don\u2019t have the right to do so."}{"translation": "In making the sculpture, the time unfolds itself.", "prediction": "Qualitativeness."}{"translation": "And our body becomes the materialization and a measure of time.", "prediction": "We need to make sure that we don\u2019t have the right to do so."}{"translation": "Our body represents time.", "prediction": "What\u2019s more?"}{"translation": "We have different speeds in breaths, heartbeats, and stomach squirming, but that's the magic of nature.", "prediction": "What\u2019s more?"}{"translation": "It ensures a balance of time in the body.", "prediction": "What\u2019s more?"}{"translation": "The degree and speed of our movement are an expression of time.", "prediction": "We need to make sure that we don\u2019t have the right to do things that we want to do."}{"translation": "And time is not confined to the clock we see.", "prediction": "We need to make sure that we have the right to do so in a timely manner."}{"translation": "It is much more flexible.", "prediction": "What\u2019s more?"}{"translation": "Because each living body has its own sense of time.", "prediction": "We need to make sure that we have the right to do so in a timely manner."}{"translation": "And the process of time becomes a complete expression.", "prediction": "We need to make sure that we are in a better position to do so."}{"translation": "Because dance is not a point, a line or a plane.", "prediction": "We need to make sure that we are not in a state that we are in a state where we are in a state of need."}{"translation": "It is an ongoing and non-stop process.", "prediction": "What\u2019s more?"}{"translation": "As long as you're still alive and the world still exists, your breathing will still be there, and the whole process is the expression of time.", "prediction": "We need to make sure that we are not in a state that we are in a state where we are in a state where we are in a state where we are in a state where we are in a state where we are in a state where we are in a state where we are in a state where we are in a state of need, we are in a state where we are in a state where we are in a state where we are in a state that we are in a state where we are in a state."}{"translation": "So I often stress that the expression of dance should not focus on a certain moment.", "prediction": "We need to make sure that we are in a better position to do so."}{"translation": "But on the connection, or the process.", "prediction": "What\u2019s more?"}{"translation": "In our years of exploration.", "prediction": "We need to make sure that we are in a better position to do so."}{"translation": "I come to feel the ultimate power of passing the baton of dancing to future generations.", "prediction": "We need to make sure that we don\u2019t have the right to do so."}{"translation": "I want to share a little story.", "prediction": "What\u2019s more?"}{"translation": "The Tao Theater was co-founded by me, Duan Ni, and Wang Hao.", "prediction": "What\u2019s more?"}{"translation": "At the initial stage, only three of us struggled to perform our work on stage.", "prediction": "We need to make sure that we are in a better position to do so."}{"translation": "But as we become older and our body grows weak.", "prediction": "Qualitativeness."}{"translation": "We are gradually drifting away from the stage.", "prediction": "Qualitativeness."}{"translation": "So whenever we see dancers still expressing themselves purely, clearly and attentively on the stage.", "prediction": "We need to make sure that we are in a better position to do so."}{"translation": "The three of us will be moved to tears.", "prediction": "What\u2019s more?"}{"translation": "Because I feel these emerging artists have played an increasingly important part in performing dance on stage.", "prediction": "We need to make sure that we don\u2019t have the right to do so."}{"translation": "It is a kind of spirit, an emotion, a resonance of our spiritual world.", "prediction": "We need to make sure that we don\u2019t have the right to do so."}{"translation": "This is a continuation.", "prediction": "Qualitativeness."}{"translation": "And dance is not about individuals.", "prediction": "We need to make sure that we are not in a

are in a state where we are in a state of need."}{"translation": "It is about people and life.", "prediction": "We need to make sure that we are not in a state that we are in a state where we are in a state of need."}{"translation": "Because rather than rendering people lonely, dance connects the whole world together.", "prediction": "What\u2019s more?"}{"translation": "Making people feel the connection with other people, and it allows people to integrate with nature through observations.", "prediction": "What\u2019s more?"}{"translation": "Loneliness may be the ultimate fear of human beings.", "prediction": "Qualitativeness."}{"translation": "We fear loneliness just as we fear death.", "prediction": "We need to make sure that we are in a better position to do so."}{"translation":

the sweat, and feel the breath.", "prediction": "Qualitativeness."}{"translation": "We can see or hear it in its most original form.", "prediction": "What\u2019s more?"}{"translation": "And let people
