{"translation": "Good afternoon, everyone!"}
{"translation": "We now have quite advanced Internet technology."}
{"translation": "We can easily send a joke, a picture, and a video to our friends and family."}
{"translation": "It's even if we send 10 Gs in a minute."}
{"translation": "But there's something hard to send."}
{"translation": "For example, you send a ten dollar to your, uh, American friend, and it'll be hard for you to try."}
{"translation": "This is because an asset like the United States dollar, it's not replicable, and its point-to-point transmission requires trust."}
{"translation": "So how does this trust work out in real life?"}
{"translation": "In practical life, we rely on intermediary institutions such as Governments, banks and others."}
{"translation": "By these various intermediaries, they form the basis of the credibility of our societies."}
{"translation": "Most of the time, they work very well."}
{"translation": "So we call them the Almighty Intermediaries."}
{"translation": "But it's like there's a lot of problems in life."}
{"translation": "As mentioned earlier, cross-border remittances."}
{"translation": "It is not only inefficient but also costly."}
{"translation": "Today we'll buy a house, and tomorrow we'll have a lot of big brothers and sisters who care about you."}
{"translation": "Visible privacy leaked."}
{"translation": "So a lot of times we're talking about these middlemen, they're bad agents."}
{"translation": "Is it possible to use technology to optimize, or even to rebuild, the foundation of trust in this society?"}
{"translation": "In August, a hacker named Nakamoto published a point-to-point electronic payment system."}
{"translation": "After the system was launched, it was favoured by various hacker organizations, as well as grey organizations such as the Gambling Organization, the Money Laundering Organization and others."}
{"translation": "The system is the bitcoin system."}
{"translation": "Bitcoin also increased by a million times in the last eight years."}
{"translation": "There's certainly a lot of speculation in there."}
{"translation": "But it is undeniable that Bitcoin has its core value."}
{"translation": "Let's take a look at the bitcoin transfer and the bank transfer. What's the difference?"}
{"translation": "That bank transfer on the left is familiar to all of us."}
{"translation": "It relies on banks, the intermediary institution, to hold credit."}
{"translation": "At the same time, it depends on the bank to help it record its accounts."}
{"translation": "Just in account A, plus in account B, it's simpler."}
{"translation": "This bitcoin transfer on the right."}
{"translation": "It looks complicated. Let me give you a brief introduction."}
{"translation": "When A made a bitcoin transfer to B."}
{"translation": "This trading bitcoin system is transmitted to all bitcoin network nodes using the P2P network technology."}
{"translation": "All network nodes then apply a common algorithm to verify whether the transaction is valid."}
{"translation": "This validation results are also transmitted to all other nodes via P2P network technology."}
{"translation": "And then you're going to put it together, based on the results of this verification."}
{"translation": "It is about building consensus and generating credibility through algorithms."}
{"translation": "And then it depends on the network to account for it."}
{"translation": "Let every node on the network be recorded together."}
{"translation": "The biggest difference."}
{"translation": "You'll find that there's no need for an intermediary."}
{"translation": "That is why, in those two years, there were many financial institutions that would study the technology, which could have a destabilizing effect."}
{"translation": "That's what we're talking about, block chain technology."}
{"translation": "It consists mainly of five broad categories of technology."}
{"translation": "The P2P network technology just mentioned, as well as consensus algorithm technology and chain structure technology, and smart contracts, cryptography."}
{"translation": "These five technologies, it's not, it's not new, it actually existed many years ago."}
{"translation": "But when they come together, they form a magical chemical reaction that creates trust."}
{"translation": "It's like 10 years ago at Jobs, with a mobile phone and an iPod plus a browser, creating a magic iPhone."}
{"translation": "We've been working on third-party payment systems for so many years."}
{"translation": "We have re-invented a new block chain system by building up technology for more than a decade, combining the technical concepts of the block chain and the characteristics of the information systems of many of our business institutions in our reality."}
{"translation": "A database-based block chain system that we call TrustSQL."}
{"translation": "We believe that technology, such as block chains, is the basic connection technology that belongs to the bottom of that base."}
{"translation": "We have mentioned earlier the issue of many intermediaries if we combine this technologically credible technical capability with the block chain."}
{"translation": "Practical application solutions are developed for specific, problem-specific issues."}
{"translation": "Then we apply the application of these foundations to optimize and even solve the problem of mutual trust between our institutions and even enterprises."}
{"translation": "That would make collaboration between our agencies more credible, more efficient and less costly."}
{"translation": "This is how real value is maximized."}
{"translation": "So how exactly do I use this technology?"}
{"translation": "Before we mentioned the block chain, many thought of Bitcoin, and some even thought it was finance."}
{"translation": "Today we're talking about something different."}
{"translation": "For example, our loved ones have been lost."}
{"translation": "Can we find him faster?"}
{"translation": "We all know that there are many public search agencies now."}
{"translation": "But we are not aware of the problems that these agencies have with information verification entry, the problem with data security, the problem with data attribution, the problem with privacy protection, and so on."}
{"translation": "The result is that these institutions are not, in fact, so confident of each other."}
{"translation": "And that makes one of their institutions, in fact, a highly isolated information island."}
{"translation": "What's the problem?"}
{"translation": "Let me give you an example."}
{"translation": "When our kids got lost."}
{"translation": "From the time the information is entered in the first node, to the second node, which usually takes hours."}
{"translation": "And in the process."}
{"translation": "It is likely that the child is walking through the second node of the broadcast area."}
{"translation": "And probably you've found it. They're all home for dinner."}
{"translation": "But the agencies are not really aware of this information."}
{"translation": "It is also looking for people everywhere, causing a great deal of waste of resources."}
{"translation": "April this year."}
{"translation": "We use the word \"baby\" to go home and the word \"404\" to find out."}
{"translation": "Using the shared account book solution of TrustSQL, a public interest tracing chain was built together."}
{"translation": "It can be recorded a little bit, it's common throughout the chain."}
{"translation": "The problem of evading this information island can be effectively avoided."}
{"translation": "Makes the search more efficient and more efficient and transparent."}
{"translation": "Uh, one thing happened right next to me."}
{"translation": "Half a month ago."}
{"translation": "I'm a high school classmate."}
{"translation": "He came to me in a hurry and said that his old man was missing."}
{"translation": "I remember the afternoon of August 14th."}
{"translation": "We helped him that evening, and we completed the verification and recording of the information."}
{"translation": "The next day at noon."}
{"translation": "My classmates were very happy to tell me."}
{"translation": "The elderly had found them, and he did not expect to be able to find them so soon."}
{"translation": "We didn't really think we'd be able to get it back so soon."}
{"translation": "Let's go check it out."}
{"translation": "Found out that the old man was found through a friend-to-friend ad."}
{"translation": "That's when we finished the information that night, we entered it from \"Baby Home\"."}
{"translation": "This information was then immediately obtained from the search point of the micro-mail, and was broadcast using the ads of the community of friends of the micro-mail."}
{"translation": "The next of kin saw the ad and found the old man."}
{"translation": "So we got this old man back in a very fast time."}
{"translation": "Although this is a small case of tracing, we also find that it reflects the charisma of block chain technology."}
{"translation": "It can actually make our society worth, and it can make our society warmer."}
{"translation": "It's a small case."}
{"translation": "Actually, we can think of something bigger."}
{"translation": "There's a very famous social topic about how to prove your mother's your mother."}
{"translation": "That means it's quite sensational."}
{"translation": "That's when we made the chain of blocks, and it actually came to mind from the time we were born to the age of us."}
{"translation": "We have always been faced with this problem, and we are proving our existence, our growth, our capacity."}
{"translation": "Why?"}
{"translation": "Because we've been working on the certificate, on the student certificate, on the birth certificate, and then on the property certificate."}
{"translation": "At the same time, in the course of this certification, we have found that we have spent a lot of time, that much money, and that we have had a lot of trouble."}
{"translation": "If we can use block-chain forensics and the application options for forensics, the data behind the certificates can be placed on a digital identity chain, which will be truly 100 per cent."}
{"translation": "After that, we'll only need one fingerprint, and we'll be able to transfer this data to our own personal certification."}
{"translation": "Is it the society of the future, and it won't appear again, how can it be proved that your mother is your mother?"}
{"translation": "Besides, have you ever thought about the future of our society, where there is really no cash, what will it be like?"}
{"translation": "In the first half of the year, a television drama was very hot and called \" The Name of the People \"."}
{"translation": "There was a Chief Zhao, who was arrested at the beginning of the operation and who was greedy of a hundred million dollars."}
{"translation": "When I saw it here."}
{"translation": "I was just thinking."}
{"translation": "If our future society can digitize all kinds of assets like cash, it can put them in the chain of blocks."}
{"translation": "Can our millennia of anti-corruption challenges also be effectively controlled by the ability to use blocks chains that cannot be tampered with and traceable?"}
{"translation": "We have just spoken of a few cases, that is, three ideas."}
{"translation": "We will find another possibility for our future world because of the chain of blocks."}
{"translation": "It's like using a technology like this block chain to optimize the credit base of our society."}
{"translation": "It's like we built a house with wood and stones."}
{"translation": "We're building houses with steel bars and concrete."}
{"translation": "Maybe this block chain technology is the steel concrete we're looking for."}
{"translation": "It can make relations between people of our future, between institutions and institutions, and even between the State and the State, more harmonious and secure, and make our collaboration with them more efficient, transparent and more valuable to society."}
{"translation": "As long as we dare to break through our minds and try, we have a heart of integrity and warmth in our hearts."}
{"translation": "Then we can make this technology shine brightly."}
{"translation": "Thank you."}
