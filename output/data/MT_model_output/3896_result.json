{"translation": "The political struggle in the workplace is a hot topic."}
{"translation": "What we often talk about is the political struggle of state corporations, but there are many friends who ask me, \"Didn't foreign companies fight? Didn't foreign companies fight?"}
{"translation": "So what I think is that the basic premise of the political struggle between foreign and private companies is that the management of the company serves the board, and the board of directors of the company is the owner of the business."}
{"translation": "For the owners of the business, the most important thing is for the company to make a profit, and secondly, for you to make a difference and not to break the law."}
{"translation": "So, under certain conditions, its struggle is basically governed by some of these rules."}
{"translation": "However, the situation is somewhat different in the case of State enterprises, whose management is accountable to the government departments represented by the National Investment Commission."}
{"translation": "So what this government is asking for is not just profit, but whether your company promotes social harmony and stability, or whether it solves the employment rate in society, especially in the case of some of the seven great-grandmothers."}
{"translation": "It's more complicated."}
{"translation": "So the pattern of political struggle between private and foreign companies is completely different from that of State corporations, mainly because of the system of ownership."}
{"translation": "We Chinese do not like the struggle, and all that is mentioned is the dark, dirty, mean means of fighting."}
{"translation": "For example, some words, such as a brawling war, a sit-in-the-hog fight, all described the struggle as very low and invisible."}
{"translation": "And the Chinese philosophy of virtue is not recommended for you to fight, but rather for a hermit philosophy like that, which is tacit and intransigent."}
{"translation": "You know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, like, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you like, you like, you know, you know, you like, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, like, like, when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when you know, you know, you know, like,"}
{"translation": "There's a lot of people in the study with a big ninja poem, like they think they're very educated."}
{"translation": "But such a downside philosophy is highly incompatible with the spirit of modern corporate civilization."}
{"translation": "And in modern commercial civilization, what we need is expertise."}
{"translation": "So what's a professional?"}
{"translation": "Maybe you'll think I've done my job. I'm a professional."}
{"translation": "I'm telling you this is a very childish idea."}
{"translation": "For a professional, you have to be able to do your job."}
{"translation": "That is a basic premise."}
{"translation": "Then it's more important that you get yourself a threshold that will allow you to do this."}
{"translation": "First of all, if you don't have the power to do this, you'll get kicked out before you get a chance to do it."}
{"translation": "So for a professional, not only do you have the capacity to do your job, but you have the power to do it for yourself, and you have the ability to do it for yourself."}
{"translation": "Because if you can't do these things, your leadership will think that you're a person with insufficient combinations."}
{"translation": "Here, I would like to raise a number of misunderstandings in the workplace about the struggle in the workplace."}
{"translation": "The first misunderstanding is that we do business without fighting."}
{"translation": "Such an idea is a silly and naive one, and it is a universal one for many hard-working business people."}
{"translation": "It's just that I've done my job, and I'm not gonna get involved in any of that open and secret fighting, and I'm gonna be safe."}
{"translation": "I can very simply clean up the snow in front of my own door, and I don't want to get involved in anything else."}
{"translation": "But there's a lot of people who blame people for it. Why?"}
{"translation": "Because he found himself capable of doing business, but the company's business was not as good as the other, but was better at fighting."}
{"translation": "And he's only being paid to do some assistant work."}
{"translation": "That's why he's starting to feel like he's not pregnant and he's starting to feel like he doesn't fit in with this company."}
{"translation": "I'm surprised at this moment. Why don't you go out there and fight for yourself if you feel like you're capable of doing business?"}
{"translation": "Why don't you go and get yourself a platform to use your abilities?"}
{"translation": "Here I have to give an example of a woman I admire very much."}
{"translation": "And that's what we've just seen, and this is what she's an ad in the American play \"The Advertiser.\""}
{"translation": "The woman, then, was a secretary, because in the 1960s, because of widespread gender discrimination in the United States, many women had come out to work and had to take on such junior positions as secretaries."}
{"translation": "But this talented woman, when she was in the position of secretary, came up with some very interesting advertising ideas, and then she got a client with an independent advertising idea."}
{"translation": "After this, did the company raise her salary?"}
{"translation": "Nothing."}
{"translation": "That's normal, because every boss is self-serving."}
{"translation": "If you can hold the secretary's salary in the secretary's position, you can do a job for me in advertising."}
{"translation": "Then my company is making money!"}
{"translation": "But she didn't want to be bullied like this."}
{"translation": "She found her leader and said to her, \"I have two demands. First, you have to change my title to an advertising case, and second, I want my own office like any other advertising case.\""}
{"translation": "Her request was met."}
{"translation": "So let's imagine what she would have done if she hadn't made those two requests, or if she had done her secretary's work on the desk of the secretary in front of the doorman, with her secretary's salary."}
{"translation": "I'm sure she'll miss her, and she'll hate her."}
{"translation": "Will she still have her creative talent in advertising?"}
{"translation": "Her talent is bound to be buried because she's angry, and her creative passion will be depressed."}
{"translation": "So if she doesn't fight for her rights, her talents are suppressed, and the company loses a brilliant advertising case, which is the result of a defeat."}
{"translation": "So, in a case like this, if you are good at fighting for your own interests, good at fighting for your position, it is good for the company."}
{"translation": "So I would like to take a second general misunderstanding of the political struggle in the workplace: the idea of giving me a title gives me real power, and it's stupid and naive."}
{"translation": "We often meet people out there who have business cards with general managers, president directors and even directors."}
{"translation": "You talked to him carefully but found that this person had no human rights or financial rights, and that he could not even be interviewed by a journalist because the headquarters did not allow him to express any opinion about the media."}
{"translation": "He could only distribute those press releases that had been distributed by Headquarters and could not provide any other explanation."}
{"translation": "Such a man, despite his title, is actually doing a very ordinary business manager's job."}
{"translation": "This kind of thing is quite common."}
{"translation": "So I can tell you something like that in one of my very familiar trades, fashion magazine, for example."}
{"translation": "Ah, let's take a look at the cover of these beautiful fashion magazines. Do you know who ordered the cover?"}
{"translation": "Which one of the stars could put on this cover? Which model could put on this cover? Who should have ordered this?"}
{"translation": "Maybe you'll say, \"It's the editor-in-chief.\""}
{"translation": "One might say, \"It's the editor.\""}
{"translation": "I can tell you, a lot of editors don't have the permission to shoot the cover."}
{"translation": "Because there's always someone on top of him who says to him, \"You're not good, I'll help you.\""}
{"translation": "But the question is, who will be responsible if you use the cover you got from the top, and these magazines don't sell well?"}
{"translation": "Of course you're the editor-in-chief, and since you enjoy the title, you have to take responsibility for it."}
{"translation": "But then you'll find out, \"I didn't take this cover. Why should I be responsible for it?\""}
{"translation": "Then your general manager would say, \"Why don't you fight for the title?\""}
{"translation": "So if you call back and say, \"I'm being treated unfairly!\""}
{"translation": "It's your problem to give you a title without the ability to get a corresponding mandate."}
{"translation": "In fact, one of the most recent news events has said the same thing: the struggle between Zhang Xian and Zhang Weiping for each other."}
{"translation": "As director-in-chief, Zhang Xian will think I don't want to set up this bed show, and it's not fair to me that your investors put me on this bed show."}
{"translation": "That's actually the problem with some directors' control of a project, of course it's complicated."}
{"translation": "But the problem is universal."}
{"translation": "Because the operator always wanted the project to make more money, but as a producer, your bottom line was that I couldn't compromise the quality of the work."}
{"translation": "If, as a total player, you do not have the ability to control the quality of another product that interferes with it, you can only point to your own operational problems."}
{"translation": "That is my second misunderstanding."}
{"translation": "The third misunderstanding about the struggle in the workplace is that it is all a conspiracy that is unconscionable."}
{"translation": "Here, I have to mention the famous Miyagi play of the past."}
{"translation": "The Queens of the Queens fight with each other more often than with the Emperor, and who can remove the child from the tummy of the Queens of the other."}
{"translation": "So what they often say is, \"It doesn't matter if you did it, but it's the Emperor's belief that you did it.\""}
{"translation": "In this typical human-led environment, there can only be conspiracies and improvisations in a one-person environment, because there are no rules to follow."}
{"translation": "Because this man is an emotional animal, and he always changes."}
{"translation": "If it is to be implemented as a regulation, as he pleases, you can only fight conspiracies."}
{"translation": "So what we're promoting is fighting in the sunny pattern."}
{"translation": "We are also pleased to see that many of China's current struggles in the workplace are slowly moving towards the sun, such as the battle between the United States and the United States of America, and, more recently, between the war on Hahaa and the war on Taeen."}
{"translation": "Then maybe someone would say, \"There's a conspiracy between them too!\""}
{"translation": "That only means that we are not as perfect as we are in the construction of some systems and regulations, which are constantly being refined through this constant struggle."}
{"translation": "The battles within all our companies can move towards a sunny and institutionalized one, so that our society as a whole can progress even further."}
{"translation": "A misunderstanding that I would like to end with about the workplace struggle is that all the struggles are destroyed and not built."}
{"translation": "Let's take a look at these two women, one of whom is a representative of the People's Council and one of whom is a member of the Council of Political Ministers."}
{"translation": "By definition, these two positions are also a profession and a very important one."}
{"translation": "Moreover, for them the profession is not full-time, but at least it is part-time."}
{"translation": "So the two practitioners, together, followed one rule: \"Oh, I will not abstain, I will not vote against, and I will only vote in favour.\""}
{"translation": "I was shocked when I saw the news."}
{"translation": "Because I think they're good at this job, and my three-year-old daughter can do it."}
{"translation": "I can say to my daughter, \"Sit there, and raise your hand when someone raises your hand.\" That's it!"}
{"translation": "I think they probably forget what it's about. It's about talking to the people!"}
{"translation": "The job is to make our society a step forward!"}
{"translation": "So from this perspective, they're actually malpracticed."}
{"translation": "They had nothing to do with it, and they should leave the post."}
{"translation": "What we are advocating is a business-fighting political struggle in the hope of fine-tuning the rules through the struggle of each and every one of us in order to bring our struggle to the sun."}
{"translation": "You fight because you are right!"}
{"translation": "I appreciate his attitude."}
{"translation": "Because I think if each and every one of us can fight what we think is right and put what each and every one of us thinks is right on a bright table, then we find: Huh? I think it's right, he thinks it's wrong; he thinks it's right, I think it's wrong."}
{"translation": "So let's put all these ideas together."}
{"translation": "Through communication, through compromise, through the elaboration of more detailed rules, each one of us has the right, every one has the right thing to be fully respected, and our society, our companies, our industry will move towards a brighter future."}
{"translation": "So you're ready?"}
{"translation": "You fight because you are right!"}
{"translation": "Thank you."}
