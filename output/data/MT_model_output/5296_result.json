{"translation": "Thank you!"}
{"translation": "Dickens said, \"This is the best time, this is the worst time.\""}
{"translation": "If you see Chiang Changjian, you can see that it is the worst of times, and that mobility is markedly reduced; if you look at my body, you can see that it is the best of times, and that mobility is very generous."}
{"translation": "I'm going to answer Chang-jian. Why Shanghai?"}
{"translation": "To answer that question, we have to go back 170 years."}
{"translation": "It is a coincidence that, with the signing of the Nanjing Treaty in 1843, Shanghai was the second post of the five Chinese ports of commerce."}
{"translation": "Shanghai has entered a fast-growing path."}
{"translation": "This year has been 170 years since the opening of Shanghai."}
{"translation": "When Shanghai opened, the imperial powers began to arrive in Shanghai."}
{"translation": "The situation in Shanghai, of course, is different from that in later Hong Kong, where they established what they called the \u201ctenancy line\u201d."}
{"translation": "It has become a form of culture and a form of alien survival in Shanghai."}
{"translation": "It follows this 170-year-old development of the sea and is inextricably linked."}
{"translation": "Let us look back a little bit on the two stages of the development of this rental community."}
{"translation": "In the first phase, when foreigners came to Shanghai, what was their state of life?"}
{"translation": "It's called \"Separation of the Ocean.\""}
{"translation": "That's why Chinese and foreigners can't live together."}
{"translation": "However, by 1853 and 1855, a large number of Chinese refugees had begun to flood into the rental sector as a result of the Knife Intifada."}
{"translation": "So the form of survival of the rental community has been separated from the former ocean and transformed into a mosaic."}
{"translation": "It has since changed a historical change in Shanghai, showing three trends."}
{"translation": "The first is its very prosperous economy."}
{"translation": "The second is that there is a large number of western and central cultures on the edge of this rent, which begins slowly to merge."}
{"translation": "So it is because of this historical trend that the historical and cultural landscape of Shanghai as a whole has so many features, perhaps six words."}
{"translation": "The first one is called Newcomer."}
{"translation": "Because it accepts the rain and rain."}
{"translation": "Secondly, it can melt."}
{"translation": "Third, Shanghai is a commercial society, so it's a business."}
{"translation": "Fourth of all, it's unconventional."}
{"translation": "Shanghai culture in general is a civic culture."}
{"translation": "It's a very, very, very popular form of culture."}
{"translation": "So why did the people of the Kyoto tribe, represented by Shen, call the culture of Shanghai the culture of the sea?"}
{"translation": "Today, when we speak of the culture of the sea, we may feel that this is a good idea."}
{"translation": "But that was a pejorative moment."}
{"translation": "So Shanghai culture is about this trend."}
{"translation": "So it is precisely because of this historical characteristic that the form of its management has become known as the \u201cNation of China\u201d."}
{"translation": "It's an interesting thing to say, in this region, it's mostly foreigners, but they live in large numbers of Chinese, but the Chinese government has no control over it."}
{"translation": "So in this lease, it's turned into a very interesting grey area, and nobody cares about it."}
{"translation": "So in a region like this, you can find all kinds of people, all kinds of people."}
{"translation": "For example, you can find some former Qing's old man here, like Xu Hongji, who was the first, Jung Xiaojun."}
{"translation": "You can find the thuwar wanted by the Queen of Mercy, and here you can find the thugs and the typhoids reported by Su, who are shocked and shocked."}
{"translation": "Of course, Chen's \"New Youth\" was first born in Shanghai."}
{"translation": "It was only then that New Youth moved from Shanghai to Beijing because he was invited to Beijing to serve as head of literature at Beijing University."}
{"translation": "This led to the creation of the Five Four Campaigns, which led to the emergence of a new cultural movement."}
{"translation": "At the same time, our Communist Party, the First Congress of the Communist Party of China, is also in our Lu Bay region, in the French concession."}
{"translation": "The mayor is here today."}
{"translation": "Mayor Chow was the leader of the Lu Bay district."}
{"translation": "So you think it's a place in the legal community, so you can find a variety of political factions and political forces throughout the community."}
{"translation": "At the same time, it is beginning to show a dynamic trend in different areas of cultural thinking and artistic development."}
{"translation": "Liminger was just talking about this art."}
{"translation": "Uh, he's engaged in this book review."}
{"translation": "I'd like to say an example of a searing painting."}
{"translation": "All over the country, if you want to achieve something on this painting, or if you want to earn a lot of money, you have to come to Shanghai."}
{"translation": "The three giants who drew the sea pie, two of them were neither Shanghais, but only one, and the valleys were Shanghais."}
{"translation": "The other two, Wu Chang-seok, one from Lake County and the other from the mountains."}
{"translation": "What about Wu Chang-seok's late life? He's been living in Suzhou."}
{"translation": "He wanted to sell paintings in Shanghai, but he thought it was an adventurer's paradise, and he didn't want to go anywhere."}
{"translation": "So he sent one of his students, Zhao Yunchung, to Shanghai to explore the road."}
{"translation": "Then after a year, the U.S. cranes make a lot of money."}
{"translation": "So you can see his drawings in a lot of auction houses today."}
{"translation": "It's a rough painting, and it's a long way from the teacher."}
{"translation": "Uh, we can also see in the diary of Lake Wu's sail that this person's, uh, very low evaluation of this."}
{"translation": "But Oh Chang-seok saw his students paint so badly that he could make so much money in Shanghai."}
{"translation": "So he moved from Suzhou to Shanghai at the benevolent invitation of Wang Qing's company."}
{"translation": "So, without Shanghai, there are not as many famous artists as Oh Chang-seok, like Uncle Ren, like Zhang Daji and Liu Hai-hoon."}
{"translation": "Similarly, where do we always say the paintings of China originate?"}
{"translation": "It's in Shanghai."}
{"translation": "Why did Shanghai have oil paintings?"}
{"translation": "This is because a large number of foreign missionaries came to Shanghai after the opening of the port, and now you see the Catholic Church of Xu Jiaxuan."}
{"translation": "And this Catholic church, which was later known as the Tushan Bay Museum, is now more widely recognized as a cradle of Chinese paintings."}
{"translation": "Today you have heard that the Tuxshan Bay Museum is a very good name, and indeed it is an orphanage."}
{"translation": "In order for those orphaned, helpless orphans to grow up and return to society, they have their own skills, and the missionaries from all European countries use their art to cleanse their hearts, thus nurturing the kind of art that will make them able to survive in this society in the future."}
{"translation": "As we all know today, some of the painters who graduated from this school are popular painters, such as the famous sculptor, Mr. Zhang Chien."}
{"translation": "Mr. Zhang Khung In is also the only Chinese artist who has had a great resonance in Europe, because he and Tintin, the author of the euphemism, Ryan, are very good friends."}
{"translation": "Some even say that Tintin's image is a reference to this puncture."}
{"translation": "Mr. Zhang Khung-in is considered a master figure in France in his late years."}
{"translation": "He made the image of Midrand, and he made the image of this Debosi."}
{"translation": "He was therefore said to have had free access to the Aliseh Palace in Paris later in the year."}
{"translation": "Another teacher, Liu Hae-won, is called Zhou Shuu, so there is no Liu Hae-won without Zhou Yu."}
{"translation": "Without Liu, there would have been no such thing as the education of this Chinese painting."}
{"translation": "Liu Hae-won's Shanghai U.S. is the first Chinese to write in human form."}
{"translation": "At that time, it was inconceivable for a girl to be naked and painted by a group of men in a classroom."}
{"translation": "But it is because of Shanghai that it is able to have this open mind and a Heiner Bichuan mentality that Chinese paintings, especially the art of paintings, are well developed."}
{"translation": "I'm going to come back to Kyoto."}
{"translation": "In Beijing, we usually watch the Kyoto play, Shanghai people call it the play, Beijing people call it the play, because Beijing only listens."}
{"translation": "But when it moved to Shanghai, it became the so-called Hae-kyung show, not only better to hear but better to look good."}
{"translation": "Let me give one example, this artist, of course, is known as a representative character of the Kyoto play."}
{"translation": "But I can say that without Shanghai, without such a long river of his entire art, it can continue to this day to affect all those who love or like the Kyoto play."}
{"translation": "This man is called Melanfan."}
{"translation": "Melanfan first arrived in Shanghai in 1914, when he was 20 years old."}
{"translation": "At that time, when Meraf\u00e1n went to Shanghai, he was also an unnamed ordinary Danhorn actor."}
{"translation": "So when he was playing in Shanghai, he was hanging two cards."}
{"translation": "It's called the senior. It's called Wang Fengqing."}
{"translation": "You can see from the difference in the silver and silver that he was at the time that the barrier was so tight."}
{"translation": "This was 45 days for Wang Fengqing, 3,800 for 45 days, and Mr. May was just about 1400."}
{"translation": "Then, at Wang Fengqing's repeated request, he added $400, probably $1,800."}
{"translation": "By the time Melanfan returns to Shanghai for the second time, Melanfan will be the first, he'll have between 4,000 and 5,000 dollars, and Wang Fengqing will have lost about half as much as he used to be."}
{"translation": "So, the first performance in 1914, when Melanquin went to Shanghai, was very important to his life."}
{"translation": "First of all, he found the Shanghai stage very beautiful, the Beijing theatre, very dark, but he went to Shanghai to see the Shanghai stage, which was not big, but very bright."}
{"translation": "Because of what?"}
{"translation": "There's a very bright stream of light bulbs on the counter, probably today called neon lights or LEDs."}
{"translation": "Ah, that's a rather new way. Well, he thinks it's very good."}
{"translation": "And for the first time, it was discovered that the Beijing stage in Shanghai was chasing after it."}
{"translation": "You see so much chasing light."}
{"translation": "The theater in Beijing is so dirty, it's nothing."}
{"translation": "Second of all, he thinks the actors on stage in Shanghai are more beautiful than the actors in the North."}
{"translation": "He started to study what he found, and the eyerings were different in makeup."}
{"translation": "The actors in Beijing are very light, so when you're on the stage, the actor's eyes are not big enough for God."}
{"translation": "As for the actor from Shanghai, it's usually very dark, it's very dark, it's very dark on the stage, it's very beautiful, it's very big, and it's very big."}
{"translation": "So, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, like, when, when, when, when, when, when, when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when, when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when you'?, you'?, you'?, you'?, you'?, you"}
{"translation": "Secondly, we all know that the people who sing the Kyoto play have to post films."}
{"translation": "The actor in Beijing posted a four-dimensional picture, and the face was very short and not very nice."}
{"translation": "But he found out why the Shanghai actor's sticker was different from the North."}
{"translation": "Later Mr. May lived on this stage for 40 years, summing up four words called \u201cbefore and after\u201d."}
{"translation": "Shanghaiers are smart."}
{"translation": "You know, this different guy has a different face and his patches are different."}
{"translation": "If you're thinner, you have to put it back. It's bigger."}
{"translation": "This Chiang Chang building has to be put back."}
{"translation": "A fat face like mine has to go forward. I've got to go around here."}
{"translation": "What if this guy had a shorter face, he put it a little higher, a little shorter."}
{"translation": "What if it's the longer face, the lower one he put on."}
{"translation": "It's a great revelation to Merylvana."}
{"translation": "That is why Mr. May was later in May's art, and he was on the stage, in the kind of vinyl, and he was very generous, following Shanghai and learning from the Hirsch's Trinity actor."}
{"translation": "But these are all appearances."}
{"translation": "What's more important?"}
{"translation": "More importantly, he learned that innovation in Shanghai, so it inspired and shocked Mr. May."}
{"translation": "Back in Beijing, Mr. May was with him, along with the members of the so-called Mae Party, and they had a lot of new plays, like \"Silence,\" like \"Tun Xia\"."}
{"translation": "So, in Mr. Melanfan's life, innovation became an important axis of his art."}
{"translation": "So, at the end of his life in his later years, he was the last play, and he became one of the most representative, uh, of the play called MacGui-Ying."}
{"translation": "It's from Henan's play, Mr. Markin Feng's transplant."}
{"translation": "So, I can say, without Shanghai, there is no later master of the Kyoto play, Melanfan."}
{"translation": "And today, on the streets of Shanghai, we are most impressed by the multitude of buildings on our outer beaches."}
{"translation": "There's one in so many buildings called art deco."}
{"translation": "This art has not survived in Europe for more than 20 years."}
{"translation": "Shanghai is the world's second largest construction after Czechoslovakia, atart deco."}
{"translation": "So why is it that a homeless man like Zhdak can find his place in Shanghai, which is the charm of Shanghai."}
{"translation": "The Shanghai movie, the Shanghai drama, the Shanghai popular song."}
{"translation": "So whether it's a literary drama or something like music or so, Shanghai will be such a big melting pot."}
{"translation": "It can be a focus of the world's attention, so it does not come out of thin air."}
{"translation": "In 170 years, Shanghai was transformed from a small coastal county town into a world-renowned phantom."}
{"translation": "And in this, we can look at the whole development of it."}
{"translation": "That is why the Times used to say in Shanghai that Shanghai was the pet of the times and a mixture of history."}
{"translation": "That is why in Shanghai there are so many coloured thoughts and so many coloured artists and arts."}
{"translation": "That is the title of my speech today, \"Why Shanghai.\""}
{"translation": "Thank you!"}
