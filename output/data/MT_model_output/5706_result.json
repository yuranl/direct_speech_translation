{"translation": "Good evening, everyone."}
{"translation": "Today I'm talking to you about a theme called \"i-music, i-love, and i-think.\""}
{"translation": "The previous facilitator had already introduced the meaning of i."}
{"translation": "It means \"internet\" and \"me\"."}
{"translation": "It was at a time when the social network revolution had broken out and all sectors of the world were affected."}
{"translation": "Indeed, everyone is inevitably faced with a choice."}
{"translation": "There is no choice, but we think we have a choice."}
{"translation": "The choice is whether to go in or to go back."}
{"translation": "So, in a limited life, we have very few choices to make."}
{"translation": "Many of the confusion, confusion, pain, sadness that we can avoid are also unlikely."}
{"translation": "What else can we do to help us besides self-empowerment?"}
{"translation": "In fact, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God."}
{"translation": "Music is our real mind sticker."}
{"translation": "Music is our only life-saving straw."}
{"translation": "Music never asks what we want, but we can gain strength and confidence from it."}
{"translation": "To be comforted, comforted and loved for healing wounds."}
{"translation": "There are so many times when we may be awkward, and we cannot talk about it, but we can find in music a listener who best suits ourselves."}
{"translation": "Instead of listening to music, it's often listening to us."}
{"translation": "So I-music, I mean, I'm music, music is me."}
{"translation": "Every human being was born into this world as a natural musician."}
{"translation": "We already have a musical instrument that grows on our throats and is called vocals."}
{"translation": "Sing it up and make your throat not just talk, but sing it."}
{"translation": "Singing, giving our fineness, our breath, our God, a brand new face, gives us a very specific direction in every day's aspirations."}
{"translation": "Let all our pains and sorrows become elusive and even disappear, even temporarily."}
{"translation": "So let's see today, I've brought you some videos, and I've seen music on other people's bodies, how they're acting."}
{"translation": "Because of the timing, all of these videos can be found on the Internet without turning the wall."}
{"translation": "It's Apple's ad."}
{"translation": "It gives us the idea that Les is more, that simplicity is all."}
{"translation": "We're not really born to die without taking them away."}
{"translation": "A rich man once said, \"There's no pockets on the shroud.\""}
{"translation": "We can't take anything, but we can stay in the world."}
{"translation": "What do you want to stay for?"}
{"translation": "In fact, learning music is learning love."}
{"translation": "The process of learning music is learning how to love."}
{"translation": "So when our people, this society, this country, music is full of every corner and music can ring in every family's space, our differences of opinion are close and many of our quarrels are relatively avoided."}
{"translation": "Many of us have less sexual ills."}
{"translation": "Is music really that amazing?"}
{"translation": "Yes."}
{"translation": "The end of our language is the beginning of music."}
{"translation": "In fact, before humans had a voice, there was already a prototype of sound music."}
{"translation": "Original humans communicate with each other by making their voices and comparing gestures. That's what we know now, six of them."}
{"translation": "So today I am, you know, not a violin from primary school, but I want to tell you, I-love in i-music."}
{"translation": "As long as there is love, everything can be a way to express a desire, to express a feeling, to express a love, to express a love."}
{"translation": "What am I showing you today?"}
{"translation": "I'll play the violin for you on this ipad, which you may all know will be there."}
{"translation": "Let's see how I pull."}
{"translation": "Because there's a gyroscope in this computer of every tablet, and this gyroscope, based on its smoothness, produces this change in the tone."}
{"translation": "So it's a highly dynamic, sophisticated instrument, and it's not as stupid as a human being."}
{"translation": "There are 65 instruments, violins, cello, um, all kinds of things."}
{"translation": "So you're saying I'm pulling like that?"}
{"translation": "Actually, is form important?"}
{"translation": "Doesn't matter."}
{"translation": "The key is that you get to be happy."}
{"translation": "That's the key, right?"}
{"translation": "Do not refuse to be happy, because it is not easy."}
{"translation": "It is an elite of so many who, through their creativity, work tirelessly and struggle."}
{"translation": "To bring happiness to us as a human being for every human being on Earth today."}
{"translation": "So don't reject happiness."}
{"translation": "Let this happiness go into your own heart and make you truly happy."}
{"translation": "How am I supposed to be happy?"}
{"translation": "It's easier to be happy, I'm talking to a song."}
{"translation": "Listen, today we're here to listen, so I'm here to listen to it."}
{"translation": "Try to hear it."}
{"translation": "Listen, we come to listen."}
{"translation": "Happy, happy, happy for everyone."}
{"translation": "How's it going?"}
{"translation": "Don't you think it's not your dream to turn your speech into a song at any time or place?"}
{"translation": "When you meet a stranger, it's a little awkward, if you take this software out, uh, let's play a game, you say one thing, I say one thing."}
{"translation": "This love letter will be over soon."}
{"translation": "So don't be afraid of progress."}
{"translation": "These things make our boring, boring lives interesting."}
{"translation": "Let our seemingly long and bitter days be marked with sparks of fire."}
{"translation": "I'll tell you about these two software."}
{"translation": "The first software is called ThumbJam."}
{"translation": "Thumb means thumb."}
{"translation": "T-h-u-m-b-J-a-m."}
{"translation": "T-h-u-m-b-J-a-m is ThumbJam, a music studio that can be used by both professional and lay people."}
{"translation": "And this second software, the, uh, fun software, is talking into song called Songify."}
{"translation": "Song is s-o-n-g, then i-f-y."}
{"translation": "It's a word s-o-n-g-i-f-y, Songify."}
{"translation": "This software is made by an uh Stanford graduate and his girlfriend."}
{"translation": "And the two of them, uh, did this software from the beginning, and they did the same, actually a sound engine."}
{"translation": "They did it for 15 months, uh, with the company and they sold it to a listed company, and got, uh, $19 million."}
{"translation": "You think it's simple, yes, it's simple, but it's not simple."}
{"translation": "Often it's an idea, it's an idea, it's an idea that can change more than your own life, it can change the planet."}
{"translation": "I haven't played much myself in the last few years, but I've done a lot of work, a lot of work."}
{"translation": "I put the material from the Foley on the Western King's piano."}
{"translation": "Let's hear it. There's no Buddha here."}
