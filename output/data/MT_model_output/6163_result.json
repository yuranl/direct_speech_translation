{"translation": "It's just finished. I'm in the role of male number two for the television series Spring of the Office."}
{"translation": "A lot of people say Tang is still in a TV show just like you."}
{"translation": "Because they wanted to find an actor of their own character and become a president, they searched the Internet, called the \u201cPresident of China's Top Ten Handsomes\u201d."}
{"translation": "They don't know how to say it, but you know, what kind of people are there to vote for."}
{"translation": "What are you saying about 20 of us standing on the stage?"}
{"translation": "Of course, Maun had a classic saying that he said, \"The wisdom and looks of men are usually inversely proportional.\""}
{"translation": "I think that's too good for him. You know what I mean?"}
{"translation": "Because he's one of the most intelligent men I think around us."}
{"translation": "I'm actually here today to share some of my life's thoughts with you."}
{"translation": "What's life?"}
{"translation": "Actually, life is a journey."}
{"translation": "If it is a journey, there will be an end, and it is interesting that we all end up with the same end, and you choose it, and you do not choose it, and we all get that end."}
{"translation": "When you reach the end, the great thing is to hang on to the wall."}
{"translation": "In China, the number of places on the wall is limited and the number of places has been occupied."}
{"translation": "So, I think when you think about this, you really don't have to go after it, and you can't go around it."}
{"translation": "So what's the most important thing in life?"}
{"translation": "I think it's the process."}
{"translation": "Since it is the course of life, we say there is laughter, there is tears and, of course, there is rain."}
{"translation": "The book says, \"A person's life without a storm is incomplete.\""}
{"translation": "I think I must be much more complete in this sense than every one of you."}
{"translation": "Meaning you understand."}
{"translation": "We looked at the whole time, and I turned it back 24 years ago in 1990, when Tang Yong was a graduate student at Nagoya University, Japan, who was studying for his degree."}
{"translation": "You see, I'm trying to keep my Ph.D. out here for a little bit of a low profile."}
{"translation": "At a regular research event, my mentor, Mr. Ishikura, was very unhappy with me, and finally he used the phrase, \"It may be impossible in Japan to take back your Chinese work and turn it into a paper.\""}
{"translation": "Think about the feeling of a weak me, the kind of pricking of a heart."}
{"translation": "I can't stand it anymore. I'm angry. I lost the information in my hand on the table."}
{"translation": "You know, it gave me a choice, or a choice I had to make."}
{"translation": "What's the choice?"}
{"translation": "I chose to stand against my mentor; I chose what I had to leave Japan; and I chose what I had chosen, and I chose the degree that I had been working hard for five years and six months to get."}
{"translation": "A lot of people would ask me if Tang Ping regretted you? That fall, that choice was not regretful."}
{"translation": "I didn't regret it, not because my choice led me into Microsoft and made me today."}
{"translation": "It wasn't like that. 20 years later, I was told I was one of his best students, not that. The headmaster of Nagoya University told me that I was an outstanding alumni of Nagoya University."}
{"translation": "I think that that was the choice that gave me a little bit of dignity and a little bit of bones in front of them."}
{"translation": "To make up for such a gap, I've read a so-called nine-time graduate student in the United States."}
{"translation": "Twenty years later, a huge web wave was created in China."}
{"translation": "A lot of people criticize me, criticize me."}
{"translation": "A lot of people would say, \"Do you feel depressed?\""}
{"translation": "What's that supposed to be?"}
{"translation": "It's an anger, it's a defeat."}
{"translation": "What's depressing?"}
{"translation": "Before spring, I saw a relative's kid smoking in the toilet, and I said you smoke in junior high school."}
{"translation": "He replied, \"The fishing island problem has not been solved, and he's in a bad mood.\""}
{"translation": "It's a depressing feeling, and what's my name?"}
{"translation": "Time continues to flow back and forth 12 years ago today, when I was president of Microsoft China."}
{"translation": "At that time, the Internet might have just begun."}
{"translation": "What is the most used application on the Internet?"}
{"translation": "It's called a chat application."}
{"translation": "At the time, Microsoft, there was a chat tool called MSN, whose market share was far ahead of having such a dick in China as QQ."}
{"translation": "But I found that the QQ user growth was much higher than that of Microsoft MSN."}
{"translation": "And I found that there's only one function that Microsoft MSN doesn't have."}
{"translation": "What function?"}
{"translation": "Talking to strangers is such a function, you know."}
{"translation": "And I said to Gates, and I said, \"If we don't add this function to Microsoft, we're gonna lose it.\""}
{"translation": "Gates said, \"Why do you Chinese like to talk to strangers?\""}
{"translation": "I said, \"That's a human need!\""}
{"translation": "He said, \"It must be the needs of Chinese men.\""}
{"translation": "Think, a man talking to a strange man on the Internet all day. How much mental qualities do you need?"}
{"translation": "\u201cNo, it's the needs of both sides.\u201d"}
{"translation": "Finally, Gates accepted my idea of adding this function to the Chinese market alone, with one condition."}
{"translation": "He said that Microsoft China would commit itself to the next three years to obtain $1.5 million in advertising on MSN to cover the cost of development and maintenance."}
{"translation": "I have a choice ahead of me, but I have no choice."}
{"translation": "Why isn't there a choice?"}
{"translation": "Because I don't dare choose."}
{"translation": "Why not?"}
{"translation": "Because I care too much about Microsoft's job, and I give up."}
{"translation": "What's the result of giving up?"}
{"translation": "We all know that MSN officially withdrew from the stage of history last year."}
{"translation": "I was thinking that if I had chosen that time, there might have been a big change in the pattern of the Internet in China; if I had, I would have preferred the Bolmer, maybe I wouldn't have had to."}
{"translation": "So we say that the great thing about life is that it's constantly choosing because you don't know the results."}
{"translation": "You've been through so much, what's your biggest feeling."}
{"translation": "I feel like I'm making a choice."}
{"translation": "It was also asked how your life came to you when you were in the most difficult of times, when you were in a state of frustration."}
{"translation": "What I'd like to share with you is that I have a so-called Down Bottom Line resistance."}
{"translation": "Let's call it a bottom line counter-pressure."}
{"translation": "What do you mean, bottom line?"}
{"translation": "I'm just trying to figure out all the worst, and when you think about it, if there's one of the worst."}
{"translation": "What are you going to do?"}
{"translation": "Can you stand such an outcome?"}
{"translation": "When we all knew the Internet waves a few years ago, I was thinking, what was the worst outcome for me, and the worst result must be that my wife left me."}
{"translation": "A lot of people say you're still thinking about women at this point in time."}
{"translation": "Being a man, it's harder to be a good man."}
{"translation": "But what I'm thinking is, because half of men's happiness comes from women."}
{"translation": "But did you think that all women's happiness came from men?"}
{"translation": "I was relieved to think about it."}
{"translation": "That's one of the ways I've chosen in my past life to be called bottom line counter-pressure."}
{"translation": "Many of us here today have chosen to listen, and you do not need courage."}
{"translation": "But at the end of the day, I'd like to say to those who came here to listen to my address, that you're really good."}
{"translation": "Thank you!"}
