{"translation": "Arjun's imperfect, uh, maybe we all saw it."}
{"translation": "We met in 1984."}
{"translation": "I was a college student at that time, and I just graduated from the Academy of Fine Arts."}
{"translation": "Then he came to the youth palace to study drawings."}
{"translation": "It has been 34 years since 84 years."}
{"translation": "He called it a mild mental retardation, huh?"}
{"translation": "So let's see, Penn, he's made more than 4,100 pieces, of which more than 2,000 are classical music."}
{"translation": "Then let's look at Chin now."}
{"translation": "So I guess 34 years ago, when such a special child came to our youth palace, I didn't even realize that, well, after 34 years, we would have a situation like that of an integrated education like special education."}
{"translation": "Well, maybe I'm the first teacher in the youth palace to face a special child."}
{"translation": "When he was born, his parents couldn't open his eyes, and he, uh, couldn't suck on milk and his body was soft."}
{"translation": "Then when faced with a child like this, they might really want to have some power to save them."}
{"translation": "Uh, one of the bottom, uh, one is me on the left, and the other one on the right is Penn."}
{"translation": "Uh, we can see a picture this big."}
{"translation": "A little body like him, waving brushes and painting."}
{"translation": "You can see that he's really a very gifted child."}
{"translation": "So, 20 years ago, when he published his first book, what about Peng, uh, we set up a class called Special Children's Art Experiment."}
{"translation": "And in this class, there's more than a dozen, and we're talking about kids with cerebral palsy, um, autism, Down syndrome, and so on."}
{"translation": "We're going to teach some of these kids free of charge, and Ping is in it."}
{"translation": "We're hoping to be able to, uh, have a case like Ping that inspires more special children to express themselves in art."}
{"translation": "So in 2006, when our second juvenile palace was inaugurated, we officially set up special education centres to provide specialized services for special children."}
{"translation": "In a year of 10 years, we had the support of lucky gold."}
{"translation": "Each year, the society is then offered 2,000 public-interest free degrees."}
{"translation": "Ah, so far we've got 15,000 free degrees."}
{"translation": "So we've got more than a dozen children, and now we've seen more than 2,000 of them, and we're really grateful."}
{"translation": "Well, because, uh, maybe it's because of Chin, we were just a small wish, and then we came to today, and we were very grateful."}
{"translation": "So we now have more than 60 courses in art education, and at the same time, we have the erm... to teach."}
{"translation": "For example, we have a hospital in Guangzhou City, we have some regular, some irregular, some in the cancer ward, uh, our art classes, some music classes."}
{"translation": "And then we'll be in the welfare home, and, uh, there's art classes, and so on."}
{"translation": "Our goal, then, is that every child will be able to make the best use of their own capacities."}
{"translation": "Every child is unique."}
{"translation": "Let them be the best of themselves."}
{"translation": "And then, in a year or four, we had another conglomerate."}
{"translation": "I'm going to show you a video of this conglomerate."}
{"translation": "It was our youth palace that walked for 20 years, and then the way of special education that we came to this moment, and we saw that we had a lot of ordinary children, with us and special children, and that we were in a very harmonious space of time like this."}
{"translation": "When I saw this picture, I really was, uh, very happy and very happy, because I really saw these kids, and they were living together."}
{"translation": "We can look."}
{"translation": "Uh, I've been sorting out some of the old TV shows on us in the past couple of days."}
{"translation": "And then I turned 30 years ago, in the art gallery of the Um Guangdong TV station, he was about ten years old at that time."}
{"translation": "And then he was really obsessed with painting."}
{"translation": "And, uh, he's still walking perfectly."}
{"translation": "And then it turned to a show like that in Eastern Time and Time, a central TV station almost 20 years ago."}
{"translation": "Then at that time, he had a more serious, uh, mental disorder."}
{"translation": "Ah, and then again, he was in the middle of his book."}
{"translation": "Uh, his mother was, uh, younger then, and then she used the sound of a squeezing to say her fears, her own fears, through tears."}
{"translation": "Twenty years have passed."}
{"translation": "My mom's pale now."}
{"translation": "The knee was operated on, and it was very difficult to act, and all kinds of diseases were entangled in the body."}
{"translation": "Oh, Peng's experience, the wind and rain in life."}
{"translation": "For example, because he pees, he can't pee, he uses a catheter."}
{"translation": "So every day, every time he comes out, it's really not easy."}
{"translation": "And then, uh, every year he goes to the hospital for a bladder surgeries."}
{"translation": "Well, life is like this up and down."}
{"translation": "He then drew, took medication and had a healing operation that became his norm."}
{"translation": "Then it was very difficult to travel because it was very difficult to hit a taxi."}
{"translation": "In fact, all children with limited mobility, especially those with cerebral cerebral problems, have an experience of having children growing up every day, their children growing up, their mothers and fathers becoming older, and they are increasingly unable to hold their children."}
{"translation": "And then, one day, they'll never be able to carry their children again."}
{"translation": "At the same time, this very common experience was that when they were struggling, they often couldn't even look at him."}
{"translation": "But I would like to say that what happened to them will certainly be ours."}
{"translation": "Why?"}
{"translation": "Because everybody's going to be old, and everyone's going to be sitting on a wheelchair."}
{"translation": "Lately my parents, uh, one over 80, one over 90."}
{"translation": "They all went to the hospital."}
{"translation": "I watched them grow old, and my own body, ah, grew old."}
{"translation": "And then my legs and legs are sometimes uncomfortable, like knees that hurt, like these."}
{"translation": "Then I don't think I'm gonna be able to promise that I won't be in a wheelchair for the rest of my life."}
{"translation": "So, when I'm old, maybe one day I'll sit in a wheelchair like Penn, or I'll push that walker."}
{"translation": "So much, when we go back to 20 years of education and inclusive education for our special children."}
{"translation": "I'd really like to say to these special children and their families, and to their parents, thanks for having you."}
{"translation": "Because for 20 years, it seems that we have given you a lot, for example, that we have just been on the screen, and we have seen how many degrees we give them every week, and then how much resources we give them, and, um, how they speak in public, express their existence, demonstrate their talents, and so on."}
{"translation": "But what I want to say is that it is the children who give us the opportunity to regain the love we deserve, to love each other, and to learn to love each other."}
{"translation": "Because we seem to be helping them on the surface, and we are actually helping ourselves."}
{"translation": "Because each one of us can't guarantee that he will never sit on a wheelchair with a crutch."}
{"translation": "I did it because I wanted to be old one day, and when I was sitting in a wheelchair, I wanted to play a taxi, not because I was sitting in a wheelchair, and the taxi sighed, that's all."}
{"translation": "Today I turned out myself, and, uh, I wrote two words as the end of my statement today."}
{"translation": "This sugar baby I still don't know your name. It's good to have you."}
{"translation": "The day when the little one of you, the weak one, comes to me and hugs me and kisses me."}
{"translation": "This sudden sense of trust and love, like a warm sun, drove away all the shadows in my heart on that day."}
{"translation": "You were so strong at that moment that you could save the entire world that was lost by love."}
{"translation": "And the standards of this society, often look at you like this, you're just a flawed, even a loser."}
{"translation": "All the children of the Art Corps, it's good to have you."}
{"translation": "On that day I saw a little secretary of our art group pushing his little partner, a kid sitting in a wheelchair, passing by in a hurry from my car."}
{"translation": "The picture is so beautiful, it's firmly fixed in my heart."}
{"translation": "Today you have me and all of us here, perhaps only for the sake of her mother's concern for herself, her son's fear for her son and our fear that we might one day sit in a wheelchair."}
{"translation": "All similar concerns of everyone will be the past."}
{"translation": "Because when we have love like our own hearts."}
{"translation": "When we can be warm to each other, watch to one another and love each other, when we become a community of destiny, will such a time be far from us?"}
{"translation": "Because in each other's love there will be no more fear and no more fear."}
{"translation": "I think that's the best thing about inclusive education."}
{"translation": "Thank you."}
