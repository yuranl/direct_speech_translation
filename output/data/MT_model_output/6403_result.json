{"translation": "I was called the previous two days by a fellow male student, who asked me, Tetsu, that you were going to speak on the 29th, \"Boy is a loser.\""}
{"translation": "Do you think we girls would try so hard to save a boy if he was a loser and his life was short?"}
{"translation": "This phone has a background."}
{"translation": "Last year our class had a thematic session to save the boys."}
{"translation": "Our school is also a good Shanghai school, and our class is the best class in the year, but we often find these phenomena."}
{"translation": "For example, in class activities, girls are included in the books; the script is always written by girls; the cleaning of classes lasts for girls; boys are long gone."}
{"translation": "Even girls are often better off than girls."}
{"translation": "So, all the girls and teachers are worried and asking where our good boys are?"}
{"translation": "As a result, the \"Save the Boys\" workshop will be successfully launched."}
{"translation": "Every boy seems to be under a lot of pressure to speak out and talk about how he should become a good boy and about his intentions for the future."}
{"translation": "They even invited my father to speak to you as a successful man."}
{"translation": "Of course, I don't think he's a very successful man."}
{"translation": "Well, I hope he's a successful man who can set an example and inspire boys."}
{"translation": "We girls, on the other hand, are an introspection, and speaking of ancient times, it can be said that the whole class brings together our girls' high expectations and care for boys."}
{"translation": "After that, our girls and teachers agreed that the class would be a great success."}
{"translation": "Later on, we held events such as the ten best boys for the female vote, where girls voted for the good boys, and how it inspired the boys."}
{"translation": "I hear time is the best way to test emotional input."}
{"translation": "As a matter of fact, today, a year later, our girls are still struggling to do the pt."}
{"translation": "Last August, I attended the Gobi bar mitzvah."}
{"translation": "In that sunny season, together with nearly 70 teenagers from all over the country, I set foot on the wall and on the most difficult road to find."}
{"translation": "Four days to complete 88 km."}
{"translation": "After all, he was a class leader for several years, after an intense rescue operation for boys, so I was prepared to become a Gobi woman long before Gobi went up."}
{"translation": "When I got to the Gobi, I found that there were far more boys on the team than girls and that none of the captains, flagmen, etc. were boys, and I started to worry about my team."}
{"translation": "Our team has a nickname \"Lightie\", he's one of the thintest boys on the team, and he's one of our pioneers."}
{"translation": "Once, we got a little lost, and we didn't know how to get there."}
{"translation": "That's when he offered to say, \"Let me take a look.\""}
{"translation": "You know, in a place like Gobi, if you really get lost, it's not a joke."}
{"translation": "But he's on his way."}
{"translation": "We were really excited when he was small again next to a rock."}
{"translation": "When they send us a warning and take us back to the right path."}
{"translation": "I am deeply moved by his dedication to the team and his courage."}
{"translation": "The other is our captain."}
{"translation": "Our team was unique, and it was not on the basis of speeches, but on the basis of fair play."}
{"translation": "It's about brushing our faces, that is, we've chosen one of the smoothest and oldest men to be captains."}
{"translation": "He's a friend of ours. He's actually a better talker."}
{"translation": "The captain's job was largely to finish, so he said he had to walk at the end of the line every day and never felt the joy and pride of the first line."}
{"translation": "In addition, he assisted the team leader in caring for the wounded and reminded the team members to rehydrate the water in a timely manner."}
{"translation": "Act as a walkie-talkie, as a charger, as a mobile medicine kit, etc."}
{"translation": "Work is very cumbersome and tired, but we have never read complaints on his sturdy face."}
{"translation": "There's a lot of stories about boys on the Gobi."}
{"translation": "At that time, they really became the manhood that we girls expected."}
{"translation": "That's when we girls played Gobi roses, and it was the best time for Gobi roses, because they didn't have long thorns."}
{"translation": "To say a word like a role, a role simply means what a person thinks of himself and what a pattern of behaviour has been adopted."}
{"translation": "The Gobi, the independent, the man, the girl needs to be protected, and even the boy who has just set foot on the Gobi can easily turn into a man."}
{"translation": "That's the charisma of the role, it can change a person's behavior."}
{"translation": "But there's another problem here. Why can the tights and captains act better in these men?"}
{"translation": "And there's a word called role positioning, an irreplaceable position, that's role positioning."}
{"translation": "On the Gobi, in our ranks, the role played by the tights is not just that of a man, but also that of our vanguard, who is the only one."}
{"translation": "This unique role is his role positioning."}
{"translation": "And so is our captain."}
{"translation": "The role to be played by Ling is that of a captain, so much can only be done by him."}
{"translation": "It's unique and irreplaceable, and that's role-setting."}
{"translation": "Because of the irreplaceable role orientation, we can turn excellence into excellence."}
{"translation": "Remember when my real long-term career started in sixth grade."}
{"translation": "At that time, the captain was asked to write a class ending every week and then take it to the podium on Monday."}
{"translation": "I'll never forget the first time in sixth grade I took that light class to the podium."}
{"translation": "It's like he's got a rabbit in his head."}
{"translation": "But I cried to myself in my heart, and you were the captain and the captain."}
{"translation": "After a week of shouting like that, I'm not nervous anymore."}
{"translation": "I was faced with a lot of work at a time when I was up at a later grade, when my workload increased and my classes were completed every day, often late in the night."}
{"translation": "Look at all the basic questions in it, and sometimes they're taken away."}
{"translation": "I hear women tend to stay up all night and get older."}
{"translation": "I don't want to get old so early."}
{"translation": "But whenever my eyes turn to the answer, there's always a voice in my heart. You're a class leader and a class leader."}
{"translation": "How can I apologize to Sergeant?"}
{"translation": "So I accepted frankly the fact that I seemed older than others."}
{"translation": "I didn't know the concept of role positioning at the time, but now I think it's really the charm of role positioning."}
{"translation": "It enables a person to walk on his path without remorse and without fear of any hardship."}
{"translation": "Do boys really need to be saved?"}
{"translation": "In my opinion, it would suffice if we told them that you were a man, a pioneer and a captain."}
