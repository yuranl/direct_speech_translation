{"translation": "Hello, everyone."}
{"translation": "I'm Oh Jung Dan, the founder of the ballet on the shoulder."}
{"translation": "Uh, because I've been an athlete since I was 6 and I was 16."}
{"translation": "Between the ages of 6 and 16, it was one of the happiest stages of my childhood."}
{"translation": "But that's for all the kids, but not for me."}
{"translation": "I'm 6 years old, and I've only done one of the most basic things, that is, I'm in pain every day."}
{"translation": "But these are all very good foundations for me."}
{"translation": "I'm in good shape, I'm in good ability, and I'm in good resilience."}
{"translation": "Only by doing this well will I be able to present myself as I am today."}
{"translation": "Later, for a variety of reasons, I was eliminated, and I was sent to the skill team, which is still a sports project."}
{"translation": "I've known my partner since I was six."}
{"translation": "Of course, at that time we didn't know that we were partners and that he was my husband."}
{"translation": "Well, it was a coincidence that the two of us, together with the teachers, became collaborators in two skill-mixed projects."}
{"translation": "I'm very afraid he'll bully me and even hit me."}
{"translation": "But the first time I saw him, I told him I said I could practice with you, but you had to promise me three conditions: first not to hit me, second not to yell at me, third not to fall on me."}
{"translation": "Why don't you say you can't fall on me?"}
{"translation": "Because this project is high-altitude."}
{"translation": "It's up."}
{"translation": "It's possible for someone down there to fall on it if they're upset."}
{"translation": "He also acceded to my request and kept his promise."}
{"translation": "So we've been working together since 1992 until now, and he's been my partner."}
{"translation": "And my lifelong partner."}
{"translation": "In a game in '96, I fell over his shoulder, and I slipped, and then I jumped on the floor."}
{"translation": "I almost became Sanlan."}
{"translation": "But also because of this accident."}
{"translation": "I was fortunate enough to have been seen by the leadership of the Guangzhou Military Region Acquis."}
{"translation": "Then they invited us to Guangzhou, where I started a new path."}
{"translation": "I never thought I'd be an acrobat myself."}
{"translation": "So when I came to the warrior circus, I had no idea where I was headed."}
{"translation": "Because when I was playing abroad, we were just a two-man skill project."}
{"translation": "A reprogramming and then a performance abroad."}
{"translation": "There's a very well-known ballet master who is also the head of the Royal Danish Ballet, after reading our work."}
{"translation": "He said, \"These two actors are so beautiful, they're like two ballet princes and princesses.\""}
{"translation": "Just because he said that."}
{"translation": "But I was wondering if I could try to wear a pair of toes."}
{"translation": "So I put these toes on, and I started my first step, standing on the ground and standing on my toes."}
{"translation": "But I'm just standing on the ground, I don't care."}
{"translation": "I'm not a professional ballet dancer."}
{"translation": "Because they've been since they were 10."}
{"translation": "I'm almost 20 by this time."}
{"translation": "So the ballet on the shoulder, from the beginning of this program, doesn't mean you know you're in this position from the very beginning."}
{"translation": "It's a step-by-step, I'm on my partner, I'm on my lover."}
{"translation": "Every inch of my skin has my footprints."}
{"translation": "Because he's lying on the ground and I'm stepping on it."}
{"translation": "Of course it's painful. It's a difficult process."}
{"translation": "When we were trying to get together, how did we get together?"}
{"translation": "Only to be joined and to stand on the human body."}
{"translation": "But the place where we stand is something that we don't think about."}
{"translation": "We'll just have to try and find out where it's largest."}
{"translation": "And then our first position is to stand on the back of a man."}
{"translation": "What if the backside doesn't feel hard enough?"}
{"translation": "Stand up on your shoulder."}
{"translation": "But where's the shoulder?"}
{"translation": "Are you standing here or are you standing here?"}
{"translation": "In the end, after hundreds of attempts, we felt that only this muscle was the largest area where bones could not be touched and where they could be."}
{"translation": "So we finally tried in this place."}
{"translation": "But in this position, you see this picture, one millimeter before and after, and I'm gonna fall."}
{"translation": "I do it every day in the midst of failure."}
{"translation": "Why is there a picture like this?"}
{"translation": "This is my love's shoulder."}
{"translation": "Every day is blurred, because my two feet are on his body, and every day I have to turn around, turn around, and continue to rub in here."}
{"translation": "My toes, my shoes, they're covered in blood and puss."}
{"translation": "In a hot weather like this in Guangzhou, the practice is finished every day, and the next day a small thin layer is swollen and a stubby layer is swollen."}
{"translation": "The next day, I'll twist it down the first move."}
{"translation": "But we should do so no less than 100 times a day and hundreds of times a day."}
{"translation": "Why?"}
{"translation": "In fact, I don't think it's much of a pain in the skin."}
{"translation": "Because of the bitterness of the flesh, we can all bear to be actors and athletes."}
{"translation": "Even if I break my feet, I'll be able to break it."}
{"translation": "But the worst is confusion and confusion."}
{"translation": "Why?"}
{"translation": "Because we have no direction."}
{"translation": "No teacher can tell me this is right or wrong."}
{"translation": "I don't want to move. I don't have technical requirements."}
{"translation": "I do not know how these problems can be overcome."}
{"translation": "Because what is done today is not good, it is not good tomorrow, and it is not good for what is not."}
{"translation": "So every day is in this confusion."}
{"translation": "The two of us were in love, but we almost separated because of this."}
{"translation": "Because every day we struggle, we contradict, we quarrel and we complain about each other."}
{"translation": "We all want success, but we can't find a way."}
{"translation": "And what's confusing is what's going to happen when this work comes out."}
{"translation": "Because in the course of practice, everyone says, \"Are you ready to trample on ballet? Are you ready to subvert ballet?\""}
{"translation": "It's just that we don't know what we're going to do."}
{"translation": "It's really that feeling that I really feel the worst at that stage."}
{"translation": "Well, I think we're lucky we're stuck."}
{"translation": "No matter what difficulties we encounter, there are times when we stop, there are times when we want to give up, but in the end we stick to it."}
{"translation": "We also practiced standing on our heads back there."}
{"translation": "Because we go back to many countries to perform."}
{"translation": "I imagined that it would succeed, but I didn't really think that it would get so much recognition and certainty."}
{"translation": "As a Chinese actor, I think that in an environment like this, um, I can get the world, because it's true that people from all over the world are here to enjoy it, and I feel proud and proud to be an actor from China."}
{"translation": "I've been doing this since the second half of 1998 until I won this award in 2002."}
{"translation": "Four years, I can say a friend in Guangzhou didn't."}
{"translation": "I came here with my lover, from Northeast Liaoning, and, uh, spent 10 hours a day in rehearsal."}
{"translation": "It's hard to remember now, but I'm proud of myself, and I'm stuck."}
{"translation": "And God was very, very good to me, because not everyone worked so hard that they could make a difference, but I was recognized."}
{"translation": "And I did one very good thing."}
{"translation": "And it really is a full reflection of my terms, my values and my strengths."}
{"translation": "Now I've taken it as an interest in my life."}
{"translation": "A hobby, I'm enjoying it."}
{"translation": "I'm almost 40 now, but I'm still on the stage."}
{"translation": "Well, it's kind of tired sometimes, but it's kind of tired, and I think it's painful and happy, and enjoy it."}
{"translation": "I enjoy the work that brings me this fun, huh."}
{"translation": "Thank you!"}
{"translation": "Well, then what we're going to say is that these are the feedback from some of the uh, audience in our show."}
{"translation": "We played at the Shanghai Grand Theatre, with 30 consecutive performances."}
{"translation": "Few plays in China can do this, and every audience can stand up and applaud."}
{"translation": "Really, I really feel very."}
{"translation": "Before each of my performances, I said that I was on the stage because I was tired, and I was really tired at dozens of consecutive shows, and sometimes I wanted the lights on the stage to stop."}
{"translation": "Can't we just go out of power today or have some kind of accident, and we can stop the show?"}
{"translation": "There's this fantasy."}
{"translation": "But it's really time to start acting on the stage."}
{"translation": "It's still so invested and I'm going to finish my last show."}
{"translation": "At the end of an hour and 50 minutes, when I bowed to the audience, the audience stood up and applauded me, and I felt that everything was worth it."}
{"translation": "I feel too enjoying that moment."}
{"translation": "It's the tired stuff that's ahead and all that stuff is gone."}
{"translation": "So I think it was the happiest moment as an actor."}
{"translation": "So to date, I'm still obsessed with the stage, and my peak, probably until 2008."}
{"translation": "So this time, uh, it's an accident to fall from the top, and I'm pregnant."}
{"translation": "It should be a good thing."}
{"translation": "But for us, I'm on the stage, and at my peak, I'm not well prepared to think, and I have children."}
{"translation": "Then when I had the baby, my body was deformed."}
{"translation": "My kung fu is dead."}
{"translation": "I can't stand on stage like I used to."}
{"translation": "So this process of recovery is fresh to me, very painful and visible."}
{"translation": "Because on a 37-degree day in Guangzhou, I was wearing a fresh film in my weight-loss jacket and went for a run every day in Guangzhou for an hour and an afternoon."}
{"translation": "And then I eat on the scales every day."}
{"translation": "And then every meal I eat, no matter how many meals I eat on the table, I only have five bites, and I'll leave when I'm done."}
{"translation": "Because that's the only way I can lose my weight fast."}
{"translation": "I think the love I have for my own work is that at that time, it was a state of enthralling and obsessiveness."}
{"translation": "And why is it so urgent for me to recover?"}
{"translation": "I found myself depressed."}
{"translation": "Because it really feels like you've done one thing, just on the stage, except what you did more than 20 years ago."}
{"translation": "I found out I couldn't do anything else."}
{"translation": "I can only represent my own values on the stage."}
{"translation": "So I very much hope that I'll be back on stage soon."}
{"translation": "My waist, my waist, my whole waist, I can't be as soft as I used to be."}
{"translation": "But there's one thing I'm glad to be out of the stage for so long."}
{"translation": "I find that sometimes life doesn't always have to be on the stage, and you get better and better."}
{"translation": "Stop this year, I think I've had a different harvest."}
{"translation": "My life, my stage experience."}
{"translation": "I feel different."}
{"translation": "When I was speaking to the audience, I felt that in my emotions, in my mind, it was another message."}
{"translation": "Everyone says Jung Dan, you're up again, you're up again."}
{"translation": "So I think it's a person who reaches a different stage of age, and the harvest is different, and the feeling is different."}
{"translation": "Because then I felt that there was a lot of this kind of power that didn't grow up, and I felt that it could not be felt until a certain age."}
{"translation": "Uh, that's one of my feelings."}
{"translation": "Then I went back to the stage, and I won this award in Russia."}
{"translation": "This award is a very rare thing for all dancers."}
{"translation": "And as an acrobat, I'm supposed to be a cross-border actor and I can uh, get this privilege."}
{"translation": "I'm proud of it, and I treasure it."}
{"translation": "So now I'm not just an actor, I'm more a carryr, a light passer."}
{"translation": "Because it is my duty and duty to carry on the ballet on my shoulder, a miracle that the Chinese have created, a technology, to pass on and develop."}
{"translation": "And I've raised a lot of kids."}
{"translation": "I hope that these children will live up to their dreams and that I can help them."}
{"translation": "And I also believe that dance children must be the strongest and the hardest to suffer."}
{"translation": "Then I'm sure they'll do anything in the future."}
{"translation": "Well, let's just say that the perfectness that can never be achieved, but the magic of ballet is every moment that always pursues perfection."}
{"translation": "Well, I'd like to say that for the first half of my life, thank you very much for meeting with the ballet on my shoulder."}
{"translation": "Well, standing on the stage, on my husband's shoulder, I feel very proud."}
{"translation": "I felt like I was invincible at that moment."}
{"translation": "Thank you!"}
