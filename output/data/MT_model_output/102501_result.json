{"translation": "Hello, everyone."}
{"translation": "I am a forest. I am both an observer of the second meta-culture and a participant in the second meta-culture."}
{"translation": "I am sure that everyone here has heard, or has heard, more or less of the concept of binary dollars."}
{"translation": "But perhaps everyone does not necessarily know where the second dollar came from or why it was popular."}
{"translation": "If we go back to the source of the term binary, we'll find that word, actually from Japan."}
{"translation": "And in Japanese, it was actually a geometry term, meaning two-dimensional space, two-dimensional world."}
{"translation": "And today, we have a special discussion of the second dimension of the word Internet popular, which in fact did not acquire its semantics and its usage until the mid-1990s."}
{"translation": "In my view, we can trace the \u201csource of all evils\u201d to an animated film called the Mobile Warship Touch, which was first aired in 1996."}
{"translation": "It's a science fiction animated film that sets the story background at the end of the 22nd century."}
{"translation": "In this animated film, there's a particularly interesting group of characters."}
{"translation": "Well, they were a long time ago, and, uh, a long time ago, when they were talking about the twenty-first century, and they were descended from a group of human immigrants who were banished to Jupiter by the civilization of the Earth in the twenty-first century."}
{"translation": "And when their fathers were banished to Jupiter, they carried with them an animated film called \"The Stifler 3\"."}
{"translation": "For a long time, this Stirler 3 became a particularly special presence in Jupiter civilization."}
{"translation": "Because, uh, the Jupiterians, not only were passionately worshipping Iron Man 3 and using the spirit of the Steel Man 3 as their own tenets of life, but they were also deeply obsessed with the female actor of the animated film, Vegetables."}
{"translation": "Think of the vegetables as the goddess of your dreams."}
{"translation": "Yet, these Jupiterians, who yearn to have contact with the vegetables, will never be able to fulfil their wishes. Why?"}
{"translation": "Because it's like us outside the screen and the Jupiters on the screen, after all, in a world that's between them."}
{"translation": "In the episode, Jupiter, an animated audience, and the cuisine of the play, an animated character, were also in a world of sharp isolation."}
{"translation": "Well, you can feel that it's an insurmountable physical and physiological constraint."}
{"translation": "In the face of such a constraint, the people of Jupiter, who are trapped in hopelessness, can only persuade one another."}
{"translation": "\"It's fine, but she's a second-dollar girl!\""}
{"translation": "I don't know if that line has inspired any deep resonance."}
{"translation": "Anyway, when I first saw that line, it was deeply resonant with me."}
{"translation": "And when it was aired in Japan, it inspired many Japanese enthusiasts known as the Mansions, who echoed them."}
{"translation": "Well, let's just think, we've all loved a lot about animations, cartoons, games."}
{"translation": "But we have absolutely no possibility of physical, or biological, contact with these roles that we love."}
{"translation": "Because of those roles, those that we love, after all, exist only in a virtual world made up of two-dimensional lines, graphics and dynamic images."}
{"translation": "Because this line is so forthright, and, among other things, the concept of binary dollars, in particular, highlights precisely and succinctly the difference in the dimension that separates us from their region and the media quality that makes them so special."}
{"translation": "So, after the mid-1990s, more and more mobile game fans used the concept of binary dollars to refer to the two-dimensional virtual world created by animations, comics, games and the media."}
{"translation": "But what is particularly important here is that we look at this Jupiterian, who, when he uses the concept of binoculars, when he uses the concept of binoculars, often seem to separate the binoculars from the trio."}
{"translation": "That is to separate the two-dimensional virtual world from the three-dimensional real world zone in which we, the real people, live."}
{"translation": "At first glance, it seems to constitute a confrontation between a seemingly real and a false one."}
{"translation": "But if you're going to learn the potential of Jupiter's words."}
{"translation": "In fact, he expressed his true and strong love for the Second World and the Second dollar role."}
{"translation": "It is this love that makes them eager to have real contact with the vegetables."}
{"translation": "It is this love that makes them devoutly adopt the spirit of steel as their own tenets of life."}
{"translation": "And according to one of my observations and experiences of the second meta-culture."}
{"translation": "We can also note that, in the sense of psychological truth, rather than physical truth, many vagabonds often get quite a genuine emotional experience from the secondary dimension of the world."}
{"translation": "Even as opposed to a three-dimensional society that needs to be confronted with some kind of masked face."}
{"translation": "Their emotional commitment to the binary world may be more sincere and intense."}
{"translation": "Thus, the relationship between the real and the false, the real and the false does not seem to be simple to judge and distinguish with a dichotomy of thinking."}
{"translation": "Perhaps it is precisely the question that deserves to be asked."}
{"translation": "Why do so many people have such a genuine and intense emotional commitment to those who are often called virtual worlds, virtual players?"}
{"translation": "Here, I'm going to introduce an academic, theoretical term to help me interpret and interpret this socio-cultural trend."}
{"translation": "When I went to undergraduates, I had an experienced, uh, senior who taught me that, he said, postmodernity is a basket and everything can be done in the past."}
{"translation": "Well, I'm here to share with you a theoretical concept \u2014 a post-modern concept \u2014 that is, a very diverse one."}
{"translation": "Different people will use it in different ways, and different commentators will fill it with different theoretical content."}
{"translation": "And here I am, when I share with you the concept of post-modernity, how do I use it in a specific sense?"}
{"translation": "I'm learning from a Japanese cultural research expert called Euh Dong-hoki, the fat mansion on the right behind me, uh, his usage."}
{"translation": "Or is it based on the French post-modernist philosopher Leotta, quoted by Dong Hoki."}
{"translation": "According to them, post-modern conditions mean, first and foremost, the decline of grand narratives."}
{"translation": "What's the grand narrative?"}
{"translation": "The grand narrative here is that, since the Enlightenment, the modern political community has relied on a set of conceptual systems that bring its members together."}
{"translation": "They provide authoritative interpretations of the rules governing the functioning of society."}
{"translation": "They give value and meaning to the transcendent nature of human practice, and they give a coherent account of the development process of history."}
{"translation": "But in the 20th century history has changed dramatically."}
{"translation": "Some grand narratives that are supportive of modern civilization have gradually lost their persuasiveness and appeal."}
{"translation": "From the outbreak of the First World War to the end of the cold war, one tragic and traumatic historical event almost destroyed the edifice of humanism, enlightened reason and historical progressive theory in these extreme years."}
{"translation": "The transformation of liberal capitalism and modern technology, while making society as a whole mobile and highly fragmented, has largely dissipated certain grand narratives of their social roots."}
{"translation": "As the grand narrative of modernity collapses in the post-modern state, it is a new generation that grows up in the ruins of grand narratives."}
{"translation": "We are ushering in a vacuum of cultural values."}
{"translation": "Like the Jupiters of the Mobile Warships, they were banished to Jupiter and cut off their spiritual ties with the civilization of the Earth."}
{"translation": "In the post-modern situation, we, the new generation that has been and has grown up, also have difficulty in getting our spiritual world together with the grand narratives that modern civilization once tried to construct."}
{"translation": "It is in these times that the culture of the second dollar has played a very important role and has had a very important spiritual effect on us."}
{"translation": "In the second dimension of culture, like The Steel Man 3, which fills the spiritual, cultural and value vacuums of the Jupiterians, there are a lot of excellent secondary works that often provide an ambitious worldview setting system while telling an interesting story."}
{"translation": "These worldview systems provide alternative macro narratives to those who are in the ruins of grand narratives, which we can also call binary macro narratives."}
{"translation": "And, of course, the secondaryists are diverse and diverse, uh, but as far as my personal acceptance experience is concerned."}
{"translation": "Where the second dollar is most attractive to me, it is precisely one of the spiritual effects of the two won's grand narratives."}
{"translation": "Since I was a kid, I've been renting this Seven Dragonball or The White Book from a comic book shop on the street at a price of five cents."}
{"translation": "When I was a teenager, I was on a television set, I was on a desktop and I was watching \"The ninja of Fire\" and \"Digital Baby.\""}
{"translation": "When I was a young man, I had access to \"Fate\" by tablet computers, by laptops, by smartphones."}
{"translation": "These two-dimensional works, which I deeply love and which I am deeply obsessed with, tend to break the line between so-called traditions and modernity, the East and the West, secularism and mysticism, technology and magic."}
{"translation": "The heterogeneity of elements has shaped an ambitious world-view setting system."}
{"translation": "In the interest of such a binary view of the world, technology is no longer boring and cold, but as if it were animated and magical."}
{"translation": "At the same time, magic does not constitute a call to the ex-modern ghost, but rather a source of wonders for glamour through the new media."}
{"translation": "Such a vision of the world would allow those of us who may identify with, and take on, character roles and possess extraordinary abilities."}
{"translation": "And in a vast and interesting time and space, there are wonderful experiences."}
{"translation": "And these wonderful encounters, in turn, are passive, new media like games that give a visual effect to bragging."}
{"translation": "So, they form a pleasure reactor, like a powerful power-eating reactor that provides a source of joy for the readers of comics, animated viewers, game players."}
{"translation": "More importantly, for me, the surprises that take place in the context of these binary world views are often given some great significance in the development of storylines that relate to the destinies of communities and even the destinies of the world."}
{"translation": "At the same time, the role of the person is placed in a relatively extreme situation, thus stimulating the emotional energy inherent in the bond between the role of the person."}
{"translation": "What I am talking about here is a binary term, which refers to a strong and profound emotional connection between human beings."}
{"translation": "For me, there is a narrative that is often seen and tested."}
{"translation": "As the world's huge crises continue to deepen, the interlinkage between the role of the individual is constantly threatened and tested by close to life and death."}
{"translation": "In order to maintain this fragile but guarded bond in extreme circumstances, we will agree and take on a secondary role."}
{"translation": "The bond of origin must be turned into a key to the potential to release the energy inherent in the small inner universe and to try to save the outer universe while protecting it."}
{"translation": "Why does such a narrative strike me repeatedly?"}
{"translation": "In my view, it is because if the audio-visual medium succeeds in creating a good sense of introspection and if the animated viewer, the reader of the cartoon and the player of the game are able to come into it in good faith, then the emotional strength that such a bond may achieve will be extremely difficult for us, secondary fans in the post-modern situation, to experience in the usual, mechanical repetition of three meta-lifes."}
{"translation": "Further, the world viewing and scenario design of such a secondary work would also allow many of the transcendent values that have been lost to me for a long time to be self-explanatory, at least for the time being, within the narrative framework and emotional structure of the work."}
{"translation": "When I see Sun Wukong, Hm-Hum-Huh-Huh, based on the principle that \u201cthe play is not nonsense, the adaptation is not a fabrication\u201d, I'll call him Carcarot here."}
{"translation": "When I saw Carcarot, he was constantly transcending his limits in order to protect his important partner and the planet."}
{"translation": "When I see a vortex of vortex, in order to achieve a world of mutual understanding between one person and another, I am constantly subjected to tribulations and tests that are hard to imagine."}
{"translation": "When I saw Knight Saber, at the cost of his own demise, and at the cost of the love of his life, I waved the sword of victory and destroyed the evil Grail."}
{"translation": "When I see deer eyes, she sacrifices her life and all traces of her existence to reverse the causes and consequences of the entire universe, bringing the ultimate hope to every magical girl who is dying of despair."}
{"translation": "The resulting feeling of blood and highness is almost impossible for me to experience in the three meta-social environments in which nihilism, cynicism, connoisseurism and extreme individualism pervade."}
{"translation": "It is in this sense that the grand narrative of the binary has, for me, probably served as a spiritual proxy for many of the secondaryists."}
{"translation": "We often hear such harsh criticisms from the elders of the second dollar."}
{"translation": "For example, you're running away from reality."}
{"translation": "For example, you're drowning in virtual."}
{"translation": "But it seems to me, from another angle, that we look at and understand the words."}
{"translation": "The grand narrative of modernity no longer has the meaning and value of truth for us."}
{"translation": "If we had been inexorably in the midst of a real ruin."}
{"translation": "Can we, then, also interpret the hobby of the binary as a spiritual quest for indemnity?"}
{"translation": "Or is it understood as a immersion experience of a super real world that is more real than real?"}
{"translation": "Well, I just said that, especially when I gave those four examples, there might be a lot of friends here who would think, \"Oh, he's a good man.\""}
{"translation": "Cough, uh, as a man who's been through a lot of battles, see a lot of second-dollar lovers."}
{"translation": "When I face three won friends, I am often identified, recognized or mocked as a second-degree patient."}
{"translation": "Well, you can be sure that patients like me who are second and second-degree patients, who are, uh, very diverse in form and form, are just one of those types, and perhaps even one of the old Fashioned types, huh?"}
{"translation": "But what I'm going to say next is likely to make a lot more disconcerting for the three-timers."}
{"translation": "Because we can observe that, since the 1990s, it was not only post-cold-war cynicism that prevailed across the globe."}
{"translation": "Moreover, in the specific social context of Japanese society, the people of Japan have suffered the collapse of a bubble economy that has ushered in a long period of economic stagnation, which has been called the \u201cpunishment of the Great Depression\u201d."}
{"translation": "The young people who grew up in this period of great depression, faced with the realities of stratification and with the fate of the difficult interaction between self-fought and the formation of history, inevitably fall into a heavy sense of disillusionment and a strong sense of incompetence."}
{"translation": "At the same time, these young people, like Shinjinji, the protagonist of The Gospel of the New Century, live in a consumer society of post-industrialism."}
{"translation": "They have access to highly developed cultural creative industries at all times and at all times, quantifying for them and generating a rich variety of cultural consumer goods in a crowd-based manner, as well as obtaining pleasure and comfort from them."}
{"translation": "Against the background of such an era, a group of, uh, royal family members, known or derided as \u201cfalse houses\u201d, emerged."}
{"translation": "Or, in the words of Dong-hoki, this is a generation that has emerged in a more complete post-modern situation without any need for grand narratives."}
{"translation": "So, the question is, who's good at digging?"}
{"translation": "11th district NERV Quangen Hall!"}
{"translation": "Eva excavator, you deserve to have it."}
{"translation": "I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sick again. I'm sick again. This was a trance."}
{"translation": "It's not my question."}
{"translation": "The question I have to ask is, what is the driving force that drives these royals to spend the second dollar if they do not need even the grand narrative of the second dollar?"}
{"translation": "According to Dong Hoki, it is neither the story of the surface nor the vision of the world that really drives their cultural consumption."}
{"translation": "It's a secondary role that shows up in the story and can be pulled out of the situation."}
{"translation": "And to enable these actors to replicate continuously the re-production of a database of the budding elements."}
{"translation": "Before explaining this new concept of the Neo-Elemental Database, we need to recall a very important industry model for the secondary meta-industry."}
{"translation": "Well, you've already heard of IP operations, or, in Japan, it's often called MediaMix."}
{"translation": "For example, after Hit the Giants became a high-profile comic book."}
{"translation": "Rapidly, there was an animated and adapted game of The Hulk, as well as a range of peripheral derivatives."}
{"translation": "For example, after Gospel Warriors of the New Century became an apocalyptic animator."}
{"translation": "An adapted comic and adaptation game for Gospel Warriors of the New Century, as well as a range of peripheral derivatives, soon became available."}
{"translation": "For example, in The Gate of Destiny."}
{"translation": "After becoming a high-human game, it quickly became available with the adaptation of animation, the adaptation of comics and a range of peripheral derivatives."}
{"translation": "It is not just secondary cultural industries that produce cultural products from multiple vectors and develop product groups across multiple vectors."}
{"translation": "Moreover, secondary fans use existing products as a repository of material for use by me, producing content generated by users of a variety of vector vehicles."}
{"translation": "For example, homogenous people, homogenous drawings, homogenous videos, homogenous dramas, homogenous games, cosplay, homogenous neighborhoods, handicrafts, etc."}
{"translation": "And that's the problem, and we can imagine that, in this IP operation, in the same people's derivatives, storylines are really changing."}
{"translation": "Even worldviews are not solid, but can be derived or handed over to various parallel universes."}
{"translation": "What kind of drags binary users to the sea of content made up of IP product chains and fans' culture?"}
{"translation": "In the present situation, the most likely answer is not the grand narrative of the second dollar that patients like me would be keen on."}
{"translation": "It's the role of the binoculars that attract the Jupiters like vegetables."}
{"translation": "I would like to stress here, in particular, that these binary roles can exist on their own, beyond what is happening and out of the worldview."}
{"translation": "So it's like \"The Future of First Voice\" or a popular product like Love Live."}
{"translation": "The role-setting of a virtual icon with one or a group of binary characters is sufficient to support a product chain that cuts across multiple vectors."}
{"translation": "What is it that allows these players to maintain a minimal degree of relative consistency for those secondary users who love them when they travel through products of different vector carriers, when they travel through parallel universes of different world views?"}
{"translation": "It is a particular combination of labeled, non-narrative human elements in a given role."}
{"translation": "Or, in the words of Dong-ho-chul, the budding element, a series of budding elements in particular combinations of particular characters."}
{"translation": "In this case, the original element is the element of the person who enables the binary role to awaken the love of the binary user."}
{"translation": "In the logic of a highly mature cultural industry."}
{"translation": "Those who win the secondary role favoured by a range of users will have their personal set-up elements disassembly into a database of embryonic elements that can be replicated for cultural industries."}
{"translation": "In the secondary sector, both practitioners and producers of content generated by users can take their own needs from this large, embryonic database."}
{"translation": "Through the disassembly of the budding elements, through the reorganization of the budding elements, through the recycling of the budding elements and through the creation of a variety of budding roles."}
{"translation": "Well, I say this as if it were very abstract, so let us give an example, for example."}
{"translation": "I've got three, uh, pretty popular second-rate characters behind me."}
{"translation": "So on my right, on your left, tomorrow's scent, she's one of the leading actresses of the 1995 landmark animation, The Gospel Warriors of the New Century."}
{"translation": "So she's also a ponytail lady, a labeled character with such a cute combination of elements."}
{"translation": "And soon after being set up by Miss Ponytail, who has been shown by the market response to be a popular and cute combination of elements, the second dollar industry was widely adopted."}
{"translation": "However, it is noted that adoption does not amount to repetition."}
{"translation": "It's about creating a new budding role in the reorganization process."}
{"translation": "For example, one of the leading actresses of the \"Fate\" series that appeared in the middle, uh, and on the right of everyone, the key player in the \"Door of Destiny\" was Phillis."}
{"translation": "They all have such attributes as pride, double ponytails, ladies."}
{"translation": "But she has a new set of novel elements that are new, and there is a subtle difference between this tomorrow's fragrance, and new combinations have taken place, which has led to a number of new budding roles."}
{"translation": "Or we can look again at Sun Sang-heung in The King's Glory."}
{"translation": "As a matter of fact, she has nothing to do with the princess of history."}
{"translation": "But as a person from the name of Princess Wu, she was also given a pair of ponytails, ladies, such a cute combination of elements, such a person."}
{"translation": "At the same time, the designers of the game, referring to the stories of history and popular culture, gave Sun Sang-hsiang the idea of using bows and arrows."}
{"translation": "So if she shows up in \"Fate,\" she's definitely Archer."}
{"translation": "So, by reference, for Sun Sang-hsiang, a pair of ponytails and ladies, and for adding, collating and combining hand-held long-range artillery, this is a weapon-like attribute."}
{"translation": "As you can see, it is precisely in a binary set that has to break the boundaries of history and science fiction that it has been possible to create a budding combination of elements."}
{"translation": "Then we'll find out that, although many of the royal family who are in love with each other, they all emphasize that the dual role that I love, and that I love, is unique."}
{"translation": "But in the logic of the cultural industry, those, uh, are identified as image symbols of the same role, whether in animation, comics, video games, or in the surroundings, hand-made, Cosplay."}
{"translation": "It's actually a specific combination of some of the budding elements drawn from the database."}
{"translation": "And it's these budding combinations of elements that are implemented and presented in every specific worldview set-up, in the context of present events, and in the vectors."}
{"translation": "So why does such a binary role, which is a combination of cute elements, have a continuing appeal to the royal family?"}
{"translation": "One possible interpretation, but I cannot agree without reservation, is this."}
{"translation": "Each of us lives in a stranger society shaped by highly mobile marketed employment and large-scale urbanization."}
{"translation": "Such a society makes it easy for each and every one of us to fall into a sense of isolation and alienation from atomization."}
{"translation": "And the decline of the grand narrative that we have just mentioned makes it difficult to establish a universal and shared social ethic."}
{"translation": "Such an atomic survival dilemma is further exacerbated."}
{"translation": "For these post-modern subjects, whether they are uh-others in human relationships or larger players as social rule systems."}
{"translation": "In fact, it is very difficult to act as a basis for determining the answer to the mystery of our desires, but rather constitutes a troubling problem after another."}
{"translation": "In a situation like this, in a bipolar world."}
{"translation": "The dichotomy, which is spread all over the room with labeled secondary roles, provides another easy way for a digitally viable mansion to be satisfied without the need for intermediaries from others."}
{"translation": "The embryonic elements that induce demand and are highly tailored to meet it can create a set of closed and fast loops between deficiency and satisfaction for binary users."}
{"translation": "And that's why, these budding elements, the specific combination of these budding elements."}
{"translation": "The CP mix between these budding elements and the budding elements can effectively serve as searchable keywords."}
{"translation": "The binary user is drawn from the ocean of that big data to the content resources that fit its needs through a variety of search engines."}
{"translation": "And that is why they can effectively act as a clear and recognizable desire to drive these binary lovers to gain a relatively stable source of pleasure in changing worldviews, in keeping with their particular interests, from changing story situations."}
{"translation": "Such a pandemic both points to a socio-cultural trend that deserves attention and raises very important issues that deserve further discussion."}
{"translation": "The charismatic illusion of the second dollar provides alternative satisfaction for post-modern subjects'meaning demands and emotional needs."}
{"translation": "Is macro narrative no longer necessary for the functioning of human communities?"}
{"translation": "Is it no longer necessary for the establishment of intimacy when new media interfaces in the post-industrial consumer society are filled with fascinating roles that are shaped by the combination of human elements and digital images?"}
{"translation": "Further, with more and more IP-operated projects, and with more and more MediaMix initiatives, attempts have been made to establish such a whole-of-the-industry chain as a way of entangled play and video industry."}
{"translation": "As more and more popular products become available, they synthesize video material from the scenery with a computer, so that some digital animations are combined."}
{"translation": "To create the fascinating illusions that have enthralled us."}
{"translation": "As more and more new technologies, such as virtual reality technologies and enhanced reality technologies, have become commercialized on a large scale."}
{"translation": "The boundaries between virtual and real, and indeed between them, are becoming increasingly blurred and ambiguous."}
{"translation": "What we can also ask is whether the concepts of binary and triple dollars, which are based on differences and are based on antagonisms, will also become obsolete."}
{"translation": "I can't give a clear answer to these interesting questions."}
{"translation": "I am here, in fact, just trying to play a role that will inspire more creative and insightful thinking and discussion."}
{"translation": "This is where I will share today, and thank you very much for your patience."}
{"translation": "Thank you!"}
