{"translation": "Good evening, my friends!"}
{"translation": "We're going to have a little talk today about why we shouldn't have transgenic technologies."}
{"translation": "So this is a very popular topic."}
{"translation": "Before that."}
{"translation": "Please cooperate with me and let us make a small choice."}
{"translation": "So we have two different foods now."}
{"translation": "One is genetically modified food, one is biotechnology food or food."}
{"translation": "All right, raise your hands with your friends who want to choose GM food."}
{"translation": "Well, I don't think I see a few hands."}
{"translation": "Well, please raise our hands with our friends who are willing to choose bio-food."}
{"translation": "Okay, I saw some hands, okay."}
{"translation": "Indeed, both genetically modified and biotechnological foods are the same foods."}
{"translation": "They're all foods made with the same technology."}
{"translation": "So with this friend."}
{"translation": "We must not blindly oppose genetically modified genes."}
{"translation": "So when some people thought that genetically modified food was a plot by the Americans to eat genetically modified food, he would gradually lose his fertility, and the Chinese would gradually become extinct."}
{"translation": "It's a conspiracy theory."}
{"translation": "So, in a situation like this, let's just think about it."}
{"translation": "It's actually a country like the United States, right? They all eat genetically modified."}
{"translation": "Why?"}
{"translation": "Because there are more than 2,000 different genetically modified foods on the market, and in the United States there are no mandatory markers, so it's not necessary to write that it's genetically modified."}
{"translation": "So the people don't know what to say."}
{"translation": "So I thought."}
{"translation": "Americans are supposed to be the first to eat genetically modified people, because America is the first to make genetically modified people, right?"}
{"translation": "So if that were the case, would the Americans have no fertility?"}
{"translation": "Obviously not."}
{"translation": "Because it has been said that in order to oppose the American use of genetically modified food to wipe out the Chinese dragons, because we are the dragons' heirs, right?"}
{"translation": "On the contrary."}
{"translation": "Then, in January of this year, the United States adopted China's unattended genetically modified anti-insect rice in China."}
{"translation": "What does that mean?"}
{"translation": "This means that China's genetically modified anti-insect rice can then be eaten and sold in the United States."}
{"translation": "This so-called conspiracy theory is self-defeating."}
{"translation": "Ah, because the Americans themselves have introduced Chinese transgenic rice for consumption, right?"}
{"translation": "So speaking, this is a very ridiculous and ridiculous thing to think about right now, isn't it?"}
{"translation": "Why?"}
{"translation": "Well, let's give you an example."}
{"translation": "I don't think our audience here is gonna like the high iron, right?"}
{"translation": "High iron is China's pride."}
{"translation": "No one travels far away and does not want to ride in high iron, and no one is happy to enjoy high iron speed, convenience and comfort, right?"}
{"translation": "But do you know that more than a hundred years ago, when the train had just entered China, the same was true?"}
{"translation": "Look at this. There's a picture here, right?"}
{"translation": "There's a bunch of people who say that the train destroyed China's \u201ctreath\u201d, right?"}
{"translation": "So, there's a movement like \"Red-Red-Roy,\" right?"}
{"translation": "So today, let's think about how ridiculous it is to take the railroad, to keep it alive."}
{"translation": "Maybe 20 more years."}
{"translation": "It's also ridiculous that we're now \u201creversely genetically modified, bouncing dragon species\u201d."}
{"translation": "So, I guess."}
{"translation": "We shouldn't have done such a ridiculous thing."}
{"translation": "But maybe we'll think about it again. What's that called genetically modified, right?"}
{"translation": "First of all, I'd like to introduce a concept. What's genetic?"}
{"translation": "It's a piece of nucleotide with genetic functions, right? It's the simplest explanation."}
{"translation": "So what's a transgenic?"}
{"translation": "What do you mean, genetically modified?"}
{"translation": "Actually, it's genetically modified."}
{"translation": "We can understand it as a technology or as a process."}
{"translation": "So let's be simple."}
{"translation": "That is to say, a technology that transfers genes from one species to another, we call it \u201cgenetic modification\u201d."}
{"translation": "Or say it."}
{"translation": "Genes from one species, it's transferred to another through a certain medium."}
{"translation": "It's also a genetically modified process, right, so one is a process, one is technology."}
{"translation": "So let's think about it."}
{"translation": "We're against the process or the technology, aren't we?"}
{"translation": "So, of course, it needs some kind of medium, and we say it can go through natural hybrids, right, for genetic modification."}
{"translation": "So, in fact, human beings see this natural hybrid and produce a lot of new things."}
{"translation": "Humans also learn to do manual hybrids, right?"}
{"translation": "So the modern biotechnology we use can also be genetically modified."}
{"translation": "So this genetically modified process is getting better and better, right?"}
{"translation": "So this is what we're thinking from the technical point of view."}
{"translation": "So we can actually think about it in terms of process."}
{"translation": "So such a genetically modified process can actually take place between different individuals of the same species."}
{"translation": "But it can also happen between individuals of different species, right?"}
{"translation": "So it's actually a genetic transfer process, of course it needs a medium, right?"}
{"translation": "Well, because I'm this guy with the fever, right? I like to take pictures."}
{"translation": "So I often go to nature and see, hey, what different insects are, right, they do this medium, as a medium, in different species or between different flowers, to transgenerate."}
{"translation": "So that's natural genetically modified, huh?"}
{"translation": "Now you can see that there's a map down there, and that's one thing God's been working on."}
{"translation": "Like what?"}
{"translation": "We have a purple corn rod of this kind with a row of white corn rods next to it, right?"}
{"translation": "Think about it if this purple corn pollen floats with the wind and floats over this white corn."}
{"translation": "What color do they make of corn sticks?"}
{"translation": "Think about it."}
{"translation": "All right, black and white, purple and white. Good talk."}
{"translation": "Well, look at that."}
{"translation": "It's the corn rod that comes out of it."}
{"translation": "Obviously it's not the same as it used to be, and it changes more, right?"}
{"translation": "So the genetically modified process, it's a creation mutation, right?"}
{"translation": "Let our breeders have such an opportunity."}
{"translation": "So that's what we're talking about, this natural transgenic."}
{"translation": "So actually breeders want to get more of this genetic mutation."}
{"translation": "So that we can sift the best to breed and form good varieties."}
{"translation": "For example, improving its quality, improving its anti-insect resistance, improving its anti-pathological resistance, etc., ah."}
{"translation": "So actually, in the process of this mutation, we can use the rays, right, to make the mutation."}
{"translation": "For example, when you look at this picture we see, right, space breeding."}
{"translation": "Put our seeds on a rocket, send them into space, let the rays shoot, and then it mutates, and this can produce a mutation."}
{"translation": "And we can put different cells together, right, and they can create so-called cell hybrids, and they can produce mutations."}
{"translation": "But these variations, in fact, are random processes, and this is a work that can be accomplished over a longer period of time."}
{"translation": "So what we're talking about today, or what the public is talking about most about, is actually biotechnologically, right?"}
{"translation": "Well, that's how it works."}
{"translation": "We can grow genetically modified papayas, right? And genetically modified cotton."}
{"translation": "So let's actually take a look at what this genetically modified process is like."}
{"translation": "As we've already said, it's a hybrid, so now it's too blind."}
{"translation": "Or artificial hybrids are more blind."}
{"translation": "So, what do we do if we want it to be very targeted and precise about the genes we want?"}
{"translation": "So first we're looking for a \"car,\" huh, like this one we call a particle, huh?"}
{"translation": "So you can cut this particle open a little bit, right, and stick it to the piece that we need."}
{"translation": "Like one of our taxis, I take a cab, right, and then I put it in a fungus, huh?"}
{"translation": "So it reproduces, from one to many."}
{"translation": "So it's going to have contact with that genetically modified cell that we need to transfer, right?"}
{"translation": "So you can see in this process that the gene on the particle can be released into the cell, and that gene can drill into the cell core and integrate with the chromosome in this chromosome of our cells, right?"}
{"translation": "Growing up into a different white and more damaged tissue, right?"}
{"translation": "And then this more damaged tissue grows into a small seed, right, and this little seedling grows into a large seedling."}
{"translation": "So the seedlings contain genetically modified plants, so we make a genetically modified plant, right?"}
{"translation": "So what you're saying about this process is consistent with our traditional goal."}
{"translation": "But it's faster, more precise, more efficient, ah."}
{"translation": "So let's take a look."}
{"translation": "Why shouldn't we be against genetically modified, huh?"}
{"translation": "So everyone knows that it is a very, very serious task to ensure that all the people of the world are fed, right? Everyone is fed and fed."}
{"translation": "So look at this curve."}
{"translation": "This orange curve represents a trend in population growth."}
{"translation": "And the blue dotted line behind is two possibilities for food production."}
{"translation": "If we use high-tech technology, right, good use of land, then food may follow the same route."}
{"translation": "It is just enough to meet the growing needs of the human population."}
{"translation": "But if we don't use that kind of technology."}
{"translation": "Perhaps there will be a huge gap in our food, and if there is a gap, there will be real problems."}
{"translation": "So, Chinese, think about it."}
{"translation": "The Chinese word \u201cfood\u201d actually consists of two parts."}
{"translation": "What's the name of a part?"}
{"translation": "It's called eating, right?"}
{"translation": "What's the other part?"}
{"translation": "\u201cReverse\u201d."}
{"translation": "Food security cannot be guaranteed."}
{"translation": "It's gonna cause chaos in this society, isn't it?"}
{"translation": "Population growth is then a very, very big problem, putting enormous pressure on our food security."}
{"translation": "And that's what urbanization is all about."}
{"translation": "This process of infrastructure construction has also taken over a large amount of land, right?"}
{"translation": "Look at this picture. It was taken 30 years ago somewhere in Shanghai."}
{"translation": "Right? Can anyone recognize this place?"}
{"translation": "But 20 years later, almost the same picture was taken in the same place, and we came to recognize it."}
{"translation": "Do you know anyone?"}
{"translation": "This is a picture 20 years later."}
{"translation": "Do we know each other?"}
{"translation": "It looks like everyone knows each other. It's Pudong, right? It's Pudong, isn't it?"}
{"translation": "So as we can see, much of the old good land is now turned into a road, right, and into a city."}
{"translation": "So this urbanization takes up a lot of land."}
{"translation": "Our country hopes to be able to preserve such a land of 1.8 billion."}
{"translation": "But so far it has been very, very difficult."}
{"translation": "In fact, we have a lot of problems ahead of us."}
{"translation": "For example, our resources are constantly scarce, and our global climate is volatile."}
{"translation": "Look at us like we're in Shanghai, you're in Shanghai, we're surrounded by a lot of water, but you probably know that Shanghai is an area where drinking water is scarce, right?"}
{"translation": "That is why the scarcity of these resources poses a great deal of problems."}
{"translation": "If we are to increase food production, then we are going to make sure that everyone is fed."}
{"translation": "So what do we do?"}
{"translation": "If we're going to increase production, can we expand the area of cultivated land?"}
{"translation": "It's definitely not going to work in China. It's not going to work."}
{"translation": "So let's do this. We'll give it more pesticides, right? More fertilizer."}
{"translation": "Would you like to do that?"}
{"translation": "Then go inside your bowl."}
{"translation": "You certainly don't want to do it, do you?"}
{"translation": "So this road doesn't work in China either."}
{"translation": "Because the ecological environment of already farmland has been devastated, right?"}
{"translation": "So the only thing we can do is make use of a very rich genetic resource and then combine our new biotechnology, including our genetically modified technology."}
{"translation": "So that we can produce more of this food at such a fast, accurate and efficient pace."}
{"translation": "As we have just mentioned, China sprays 2 million tons of pesticides every year in our farmlands."}
{"translation": "You can think of 2 million tons of pesticides, right?"}
{"translation": "But now we can use an alternative technology, and we can use genetically modified insect-resistant rice."}
{"translation": "Look at this picture, right? It's genetically modified anti-insect rice. Right?"}
{"translation": "And that normal, non-insect-resistant rice, right?"}
{"translation": "In the absence of pesticides, you see the difference between them is very, very large, isn't it?"}
{"translation": "So let's just say that our tradition wants to bring a useful gene like that white ball, right, to a better breed, and the traditional way is just that."}
{"translation": "But it takes a long time and is less accurate."}
{"translation": "So we are actually doing the same thing in the present way."}
{"translation": "But you can see that we can be more efficient, accurate and expand this method of crossing this reproductive barrier for genetically modified purposes, right?"}
{"translation": "For example, we want this Hu Yang, a drought-resistant Hu Yang, to transfer its drought-resistant genes to rice, and it's obvious that we can't do it in a hybrid way."}
{"translation": "But we use biotechnology and I use genetically modified technology, and we can do that easily, right?"}
{"translation": "So this genetically modified technology is really a very good technology."}
{"translation": "But maybe our friend will ask, say you're so good with this transgenic. Is there any other problem with it?"}
{"translation": "So, actually, genetically modified as a new technology, it does have problems with it, right?"}
{"translation": "Well, that's all we're gonna solve."}
{"translation": "You think it's the first thing that exists is that we call it \"food for the people\", right?"}
{"translation": "Does it have food as a matter of food security, right? Does it cause problems, sickness, etc., right?"}
{"translation": "So there's still what it's gonna do to the environment, right?"}
{"translation": "Then other than that."}
{"translation": "So there are others that say, for example, we should label our genetically modified foods so that people have the right to know and choose, right?"}
{"translation": "So there's a lot of options about whether the country's laws and regulations are going to do these things and so on."}
{"translation": "Actually."}
{"translation": "In our country, there is a very perfect statute governing this matter, isn't there?"}
{"translation": "And, in other words, we transgenic any one of our GMs, and as it enters into the production of a commodity, it must make a rigorous assessment of the safety that it can sell and commercialize only when it is safe."}
{"translation": "So say it."}
{"translation": "International agencies believe that genetically modified foods, genetically modified products, are safe."}
{"translation": "The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) of the international community also believes that genetically modified products are safe and legitimate."}
{"translation": "Because it's genetically modified around the world, and it's done in this framework."}
{"translation": "Okay, so let's see, we just talked about transgenics, right? Why can't we oppose transgenics?"}
{"translation": "So now, as Chinese, why should we not come to reverse our genes? Let's come and see."}
{"translation": "So the whole world's been genetically modified, right, almost 20 years."}
{"translation": "In the process."}
{"translation": "The area of such a genetically modified crop has expanded very rapidly, right, and now stands at 180 million hectares, and I've calculated an area of approximately 2.7 billion or 2.8 billion acres."}
{"translation": "Look at this green line, which is a green line that shows an overall area of genetically modified cultivation."}
{"translation": "The red blue line is an indication of the developed countries, right, of the area under cultivation."}
{"translation": "The red line is for developing countries."}
{"translation": "As you can see, developing countries have exceeded this area of cultivation in developed countries."}
{"translation": "But in such a situation, where the world is growing upwards, we in China are."}
{"translation": "You see, since 2002, we've ranked 4th, right, 5th, 6th, and now we're ranked 8th, right?"}
{"translation": "That is why it is very inconsistent with the status of our country."}
{"translation": "Here's a set of data that you can come and see."}
{"translation": "So, in 2001, China ranked fourth, with the United States, Canada, Argentina, and so on."}
{"translation": "But after 2003, right, Brazil will outnumber us, and then by 2007, India will outnumber us, so we'll be sixth."}
{"translation": "It's a shame, huh?"}
{"translation": "So India used to be an importer of cotton."}
{"translation": "Because it quoted the technology, it became an exporter of cotton, right?"}
{"translation": "So China is already smaller than it is, and that's a lot smaller than it is, isn't it?"}
{"translation": "And China has been in sixth place for many years, and many smaller countries are catching up with China."}
{"translation": "Then, in 2016, China will be in eighth place, and even Paraguay, Paraguay, Pakistan, will outnumber us, right?"}
{"translation": "I was thinking about what kind of country Paraguay was after China for about 10 years."}
{"translation": "Then Paraguay was a very small country in South America, with a population of over 6 million, right?"}
{"translation": "A country of 1.4 billion people and a country of 6 million people."}
{"translation": "Such a difference between them is very inconsistent, isn't it, in all respects, with the status of our country?"}
{"translation": "So let us say it."}
{"translation": "Backwards, backsliding, huh?"}
{"translation": "Because genetically modified is a technology that makes money, genetically modified is also a technologically high ground."}
{"translation": "If we do not occupy this high ground, others will surely do so."}
{"translation": "When we are still debating whether we should develop or not to use it."}
{"translation": "Many countries have quietly surpassed us."}
{"translation": "So this phenomenon, I think, is very, very serious."}
{"translation": "Food security was also a very important issue."}
{"translation": "Our country is now importing 100 million tons of food annually."}
{"translation": "100 million tons of food."}
{"translation": "What's the concept, huh?"}
{"translation": "I calculated that each person, compared to the Chinese, imports 70 kilograms of food."}
{"translation": "What if they don't import us?"}
{"translation": "Then we'll have a bigger problem than that, won't we?"}
{"translation": "So if we don't develop."}
{"translation": "That's an opportunity to lose, isn't it?"}
{"translation": "So we actually think about China's genetically modified production, and we had a great time."}
{"translation": "China's success in genetically modified cotton is not just the one that saved the cotton industry in China."}
{"translation": "And it makes the whole world feel so great. It's remarkable, isn't it?"}
{"translation": "So when you think about the past, when our genetically modified papaya is not on the market, there's no way for farmers to deal with this virus, is there?"}
{"translation": "But today we see their happy faces with anti-viral genetically modified cotton."}
{"translation": "This is when we feel how creative this technology is and how happy it is for us, right?"}
{"translation": "So I think it is my hope that our technology will make our lives a better place."}
{"translation": "All right, thank you!"}
