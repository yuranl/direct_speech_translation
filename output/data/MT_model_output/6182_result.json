{"translation": "I'm a lawyer."}
{"translation": "A friend asked me the other day, \"What's the most important thing that you've been working for over a decade?\""}
{"translation": "Looking back carefully, it was not really those cases in which hundreds of millions of dollars had been marked, nor those in which the Supreme People's Court had been sitting."}
{"translation": "Can you imagine that?"}
{"translation": "It's a case of $475.83 cents."}
{"translation": "In 2005, I entered the industry a few years ago and took over a small case."}
{"translation": "My client's from out of town."}
{"translation": "We rented a living house in our city."}
{"translation": "He subsequently had to check out early because of the mobility problem."}
{"translation": "In other words, the landlord needs to be asked in advance to cancel the lease."}
{"translation": "Well, it wasn't a big deal."}
{"translation": "My client has a deposit at the landlord's place, and the two sides are taking care of it."}
{"translation": "The deduction shall be reduced."}
{"translation": "Finally, the landlord should return my client $475.83 cents."}
{"translation": "There's nothing to talk about."}
{"translation": "At that time, however, the landlord was obsessed with refusing to return the $475."}
{"translation": "I guess the landlord was thinking, you're a stranger, you're no big deal, you can't take more than $400."}
{"translation": "My client wouldn't have eaten this dumb loss."}
{"translation": "The case was brought before the court by a direct attorney and he was brought before the court on a petition."}
{"translation": "It's funny to say. Is there any need for a lawsuit on such a simple matter?"}
{"translation": "But what you can't imagine is that this landlord is using a local relationship."}
{"translation": "The first instance ruled that he did not have to refund the $475."}
{"translation": "Don't tell me what my client feels like."}
{"translation": "It's a blow to my newly-applied lawyer."}
{"translation": "I have a direct influence on my judgment about the values of life."}
{"translation": "In any case, an appeal is to be filed."}
{"translation": "In the court of second instance, the final judgement was rendered after our due process, multiplicity of evidence, four rounds of negotiations and eight rounds of negotiations."}
{"translation": "Finally asked him to refund the money."}
{"translation": "But can you imagine, it's not that simple."}
{"translation": "This small case is in the implementation phase."}
{"translation": "The implementation process is not complicated."}
{"translation": "The judge called the parties and me to the office and, in front of everyone, asked the landlord to bring out $475 in cash and to give it to my client."}
{"translation": "But just the moment we left, something unexpected happened."}
{"translation": "On his way out, the landlord pointed his finger at my nose and said, \"Ingent Ken, two shoulders carrying a head, we'll see.\""}
{"translation": "At that moment, my mind was coming to a halt."}
{"translation": "As for that, it's $475."}
{"translation": "Anyway, I snuck out the back door of the court that day."}
{"translation": "It's a good thing we haven't met this brother in years."}
{"translation": "I guess he's not on the scene today, or else it's really troublesome."}
{"translation": "It's not so simple to think about it now."}
{"translation": "Why would anyone want to break the rules of our society for $475? Would they want to break the rules of a simple tenancy contract?"}
{"translation": "Are we born with such impulses?"}
{"translation": "China has been reforming and opening up for more than three decades, and the establishment of the rule of law has indeed been marked by progress and development."}
{"translation": "But there are often social phenomena that we see."}
{"translation": "I, for my part, now serve a lot of corporate clients."}
{"translation": "I find that when the bosses often encounter problems and disputes, the first thing that comes to mind is the mayor, the director and the director."}
{"translation": "Because of my work relationship, I often go with my friends to see them for a long time."}
{"translation": "One day, I accompanied a friend of mine to visit the president of our local Intermediate People's Court."}
{"translation": "In the chatting process, I found out that the director, who was close to the age of 50, was not familiar with many of the rules in force and was accustomed to judging things by experience."}
{"translation": "So, I'm going to print out a copy of the existing regulations on something and hand it over quietly to this president."}
{"translation": "I didn't think the Dean would look at this thing and say to me, \"What is it? It's not up to our brothers.\""}
{"translation": "Wow, at that time you really knew what Simon was talking about."}
{"translation": "Why?"}
{"translation": "Why do we now, law enforcers, rulers, often ignore the rules for their existence?"}
{"translation": "Why do they often use the rules system as a tool and a play for themselves?"}
{"translation": "Why is there no sense of respect and respect for the rules in their hearts?"}
{"translation": "Is this what George W. Bush says, \"The power is not in a cage\"?"}
{"translation": "In the present society, there are a lot of strange social phenomena."}
{"translation": "That is what we have just said about those who have power as rulers, and is it not true that, as an ordinary, powerless general public like us, there will be no violations of the rules?"}
{"translation": "You won't cross the mine?"}
{"translation": "About 10 years ago, there was a strange case in the northeast."}
{"translation": "There was a school that organized group trips for teachers during summer holidays."}
{"translation": "When the bus service arrived at a rest area on the national road, an armed robber came from under the car."}
{"translation": "This little robber doesn't look too old, he looks 14 or 5, but the knife in his hand scares everyone."}
{"translation": "As a result, the robbers looted everyone's belongings from the rear to the head of the vehicle."}
{"translation": "Just as the robbers arrived, they saw a young and beautiful teacher sitting at the door with a golden necklace on his neck."}
{"translation": "With all due respect, the robber reached out and grabbed the necklace around his neck."}
{"translation": "The teacher, who thought the robber was coming and sexually assaulted herself, began to resist instinctively."}
{"translation": "The girls' clothes were torn apart by both sides during the scavenging process."}
{"translation": "In a hurry, the female teacher took a bunch of books from her hand and threw them at the robbers."}
{"translation": "That's a terrible blow. I knocked a little robber out of his head."}
{"translation": "At that time, all of the 20 teachers in the car rose up and punched and kicked the little robbers who had lost their resistance."}
{"translation": "By the time the robber was finally handed over to the public, almost half of his life had been lost."}
{"translation": "Why?"}
{"translation": "We found that at that time, the 20 or so people called \u201cteachers\u201d had completely ignored the existence of the rules."}
{"translation": "At that moment, these two dozen people released the magic of their hearts, and they had forgotten the existence of a system of social rules."}
{"translation": "Even forgetting that even the robbers have the right to be tried."}
{"translation": "Is there no such sense of piety and respect for the rules in the minds of our nation?"}
{"translation": "I guess, no."}
{"translation": "We recall the intellectual and cultural history of the Chinese nation for more than 2,000 years."}
{"translation": "During the war in Spring and Fall, more than 2,500 years ago, our Chinese society had at the same time the birth of such important ideas as a Confucian, a Taoist, a Frenchman, a Murdoch and others."}
{"translation": "But what I am trying to say today is that the current sociology is prevalent, but it is never the same as Confucianism."}
{"translation": "Let's talk about the Murphys today."}
{"translation": "It speaks of understanding and reverence of the rule system, which belongs to the Ink family."}
{"translation": "The Ink family is a very disciplined group, known by its leaders as the giants."}
{"translation": "During the war country of about 400 A.D., the fourth generation of the giants lived in Qin and their son killed."}
{"translation": "In accordance with the law, they shall be executed."}
{"translation": "But the then King of Qin Hye felt that he was too old to kill a son."}
{"translation": "But the stomach says, \u201cThe law of the Ink family states that `the death of the murderer, the death penalty for the wounded' is a necessary means of prohibiting the killing of the person, which is in the best interest of the world\u201d."}
{"translation": "So he decided to kill his son."}
{"translation": "This story is a vivid illustration of the understanding of the rules system among the Indo family, which has reached a level of piety and even what can be called faith."}
{"translation": "Isn't that the spirit that we now need in a society governed by the rule of law?"}
{"translation": "Isn't it even what we need to run a Chinese business now?"}
{"translation": "But how did you get that spirit?"}
{"translation": "At this point in time, I think it is necessary to look at the core of the ink's thinking."}
{"translation": "For more than 2,000 years, the heart of Moji thought has always been the word of love."}
{"translation": "The idea of \u201calong love\u201d emphasizes that love between brothers and sisters of the subjects is based on equality."}
{"translation": "In the light of this simple concept of equality, a sense of respect and respect for the rule-of-law system, as we now call it, has been created in the family."}
{"translation": "As we can see, the philosophy of \u201ccompassion\u201d gives rise to a social concept of equality, which creates the social environment of the rule of law."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, however, this important idea has not become the mainstream of society in the future."}
{"translation": "During China's West Han period, about 2,000 years ago, a husband named Dong Jong-suk and his master, Han Wu Emperor, jointly launched a policy of \u201cdestroying hundreds of families and exclusives\u201d."}
{"translation": "Under this policy, society is guided by the notion of the feudal hierarchy of kings, subjects, fathers and sons."}
{"translation": "As a result, there is no equality in society, and society is no longer in a position to do so."}
{"translation": "That perception continues to this day and remains in today's Chinese society."}
{"translation": "We can see that some people violate the rules of society and even the law, but instead receive a special treatment, including special areas of supervision, because of their particular background and status."}
{"translation": "Some people, owing to the background of the official family, were treated in a special way when travelling, including driving out of police cars and entering the scenery area."}
{"translation": "Some people have special status."}
{"translation": "A girlfriend has to go to a hotel to open a room, including being filmed by surveillance cameras."}
{"translation": "What we need more in our society is the concept of the rule of law, which is free and equal, but which is not easy to come by."}
{"translation": "Fortunately, the advent of the Internet era has given us a glimmer of hope and light."}
{"translation": "We have found that in an Internet society, we can de-identify and de-centralize equal communication."}
{"translation": "In an Internet society, people have created a community based on simple, simple and useful rules."}
{"translation": "In communities with this concept of equality, we can communicate on an equal footing."}
{"translation": "I am confident that the social system and the tide of society will contribute to the creation of a society in which all of us look for the rule of law that is equal and free."}
{"translation": "Thank you."}
