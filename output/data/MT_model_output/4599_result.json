{"translation": "This sentence should be very familiar to you."}
{"translation": "It's from an article in our middle school textbooks called \"For Learning\"."}
{"translation": "It makes a very simple point. Is it difficult and simple to do things in this world?"}
{"translation": "If you do, the harder it becomes simpler; if you do not, the simpler it becomes harder."}
{"translation": "Does something like this happen around us all the time?"}
{"translation": "We've had a lot of dreams since we were young. How many things have you achieved?"}
{"translation": "At the 2010 Expo, I saw a story about a little girl in the American Pavilion called Ryan."}
{"translation": "A sanitary corner of a building waste dump was found in her neighbourhood."}
{"translation": "She wondered if it was possible to turn this sanitary corner into a beautiful garden through her actions."}
{"translation": "She's on the move."}
{"translation": "She put flowers out of her house and planted them in that sanitary corner."}
{"translation": "But when she turned around and took the second pot, the flower was stomped on by the hipsters of the community."}
{"translation": "But she didn't give up."}
{"translation": "And again and again and again and again and again."}
{"translation": "In the end, she moved the apathy of her neighbours in the community to complete with her the plan for the construction of this beautiful garden."}
{"translation": "More than that, the entire community grew flowers on the balcony for every household, making the community spring."}
{"translation": "I don't know if you're feeling anything when you look at this movie, and I feel like, \"Oh, is this happening in our country? Is this happening in the community I live in?\""}
{"translation": "In June 2011, I went to Shenzhen for a volunteer project."}
{"translation": "I went to a beautiful beach in Shenzhen, in South Australia, called West Shore Beach."}
{"translation": "The beach is just home because it is a beach that has not yet been fully developed commercially."}
{"translation": "Young people in the area prefer to camp on the beach, with tents on a coastline like this one kilometre long."}
{"translation": "We call it a Chinese camp. What's a Chinese camp?"}
{"translation": "You can guess."}
{"translation": "When they leave, they'll leave a lot of stuff behind. What?"}
{"translation": "Garbage."}
{"translation": "Yeah, they're gone, leave that piece of garbage behind."}
{"translation": "Some even bury their garbage with sand."}
{"translation": "That could get people in the back on their feet."}
{"translation": "I went swimming, and when I saw this, I hesitated."}
{"translation": "Can I swim?"}
{"translation": "A wave up, a bubble bowl down."}
{"translation": "A wave came up and a bunch of cigarettes went down."}
{"translation": "If I go swimming, breathe, half bowl of noodles, breathe, three cigarette butts."}
{"translation": "Can't swim."}
{"translation": "At this point, do I choose to go away, or do I choose to act?"}
{"translation": "I think about the little girl in Ryan. I want to move."}
{"translation": "I want tourists on the beach to clean up this beach with me."}
{"translation": "I began to observe that there were teams on the beach that were pulling out the camp."}
{"translation": "So I ran up front, and I helped them to draw the camp, and I watched who was their leader."}
{"translation": "There's a girl named Zhang, \"Ah, don't forget anything.\""}
{"translation": "Oh, it's supposed to be a little boss."}
{"translation": "I went up there to use our Shanghai boys' advantage to carry her bag."}
{"translation": "And then help them put the bag at their assembly point, and when she put it down, she thanked me, \"Thank you. Which group are you in?\""}
{"translation": "Oh, she told me that they weren't really a unit, that maybe they were all coming together."}
{"translation": "We don't know each other well."}
{"translation": "I said, \"Oh, I'm not with you. I'm a tourist.\""}
{"translation": "\"Wow, that's very kind of you.\""}
{"translation": "\"But I have an identity today. I'm a volunteer.\""}
{"translation": "\"Volunteers? What do you do?\""}
{"translation": "\u201cI am in a more special position today as a volunteer recruiter.\u201d"}
{"translation": "\"Recruiting volunteers. What are you doing?\""}
{"translation": "And I said, \"Well, it's nice to get rid of all the garbage when you leave, but don't you think this beach is dirty?\""}
{"translation": "\"Ah, it's dirty.\""}
{"translation": "\"Can you stay with me for an hour for a beach cleaning volunteer?\""}
{"translation": "\"Well, it may not be convenient, because we're gathering for dinner right now, and after dinner we have a training session, we don't have time, and our boss is not here, and the boss is going to contact the bus.\""}
{"translation": "Reject."}
{"translation": "I said."}
{"translation": "\"Well, I'll bet you that if I win this bet, I'll ask you to come with me to pick up the garbage; if I lose this bet, I'll go pick up the garbage alone.\""}
{"translation": "I don't really expect people to be willing to bet on me."}
{"translation": "I just wanted to be able to know that I was a volunteer who didn't give up easily, just so you could continue to be attracted to my goals."}
{"translation": "I went back to my place to get a game that we developed ourselves."}
{"translation": "This game, it's called green chess, and it's about caring for the environment and low-carbon travel."}
{"translation": "And I said to all of their companions on that day, \"If any boy can tear the board of my game, I'll lose, and if you can't tear it, I'll win.\""}
{"translation": "A couple of boys up here, they won't tear it up."}
{"translation": "Yes, because I made this board with a special material."}
{"translation": "Obviously this bet I won."}
{"translation": "That's when their boss came."}
{"translation": "Their boss came up, and I said, \"Hey, boss, can you do me a favor? Organize your team for an hour and we'll volunteer.\""}
{"translation": "The boss said, \"Oh, I'm so sorry. We don't have time.\""}
{"translation": "Still refuse."}
{"translation": "I said, \"Can you do it for half an hour?\""}
{"translation": "\"Oh, I'm so sorry. The bus has arrived and the air conditioning is on.\""}
{"translation": "\"How about 15 minutes?\""}
{"translation": "\"Well, let's talk about it.\""}
{"translation": "But at this point in time, because of my constant efforts, many of their companions have actually been moved."}
{"translation": "One of the boys jumped out, \"Oh, 15 minutes, let's go!\""}
{"translation": "In his words, he touched all of them and eventually all of them joined me in my action."}
{"translation": "It took me almost 15 minutes to get 30 people into my garbage collection, and they were very happy."}
{"translation": "It's not just that, because in 15 minutes, Shanghai people still have a more faithful character."}
{"translation": "How can I finish that long coastline?"}
{"translation": "But at this time, I'm not the same as I was before."}
{"translation": "You can see the pattern at the lower right corner."}
{"translation": "There's a two-metre-high platform on it, and there's 20 people sitting on it, and they're going to spit on the beach."}
{"translation": "And I went up and I said, \"Hey, guys, can we go ahead and give you this piece in front of you?\""}
{"translation": "\"Who are you?\""}
{"translation": "\"We volunteer, y'all.\""}
{"translation": "There was a young man up there, and I guess his English name was Jack, because he jumped off it."}
{"translation": "As soon as he jumped off, a girl next to him, whose English name was probably Rose, jumped."}
{"translation": "You jump, I jump."}
{"translation": "When these two jump, 30 of us look up, and the 20 get high, and I'm sorry, they're all coming down from above."}
{"translation": "Fifty men with me are picking up garbage."}
{"translation": "Picked up the later boss's special pleasure to bring the garbage together and take a photo."}
{"translation": "You might think it's over."}
{"translation": "Actually, no."}
{"translation": "And I asked the boss, and I said, \"Hey, boss, today we're going to get this garbage. Will this beach be clean tomorrow?\""}
{"translation": "The boss says, \"Well, maybe it's possible, maybe it's impossible.\""}
{"translation": "And I said, \"Well, look, we have a wall behind us, a wall of grey, and what do you think if we do another activity, do this wall for environmental graffiti, and advocate for all who come to live up to the idea of protecting the environment on the beach?\""}
{"translation": "The boss said, \"That's great. Our team will draw.\""}
{"translation": "And I said, \"Okay, I'll work with you, I'll take care of the paint, you take care of the people.\""}
{"translation": "Are you looking forward to the results in a month?"}
{"translation": "A hundred volunteers came back a month later and drew a 36-metre wall."}
{"translation": "The story isn't over yet. They're having too much fun."}
{"translation": "Six months later, they felt that the map was too implicit six months ago."}
{"translation": "Upon return, a 50-metre wall was found, drawing the words \u201cand the fish become friends and take the garbage with them\u201d."}
{"translation": "A lot of people said, \"Hey, Zhang Ning, we can't do this. You're the only one who can do it. You're such a fool.\""}
{"translation": "In fact, we often do volunteer activities, and we often hear that."}
{"translation": "What's got me out of action?"}
{"translation": "It's like, \"Ah, there's no one to support it. I can't do it alone.\""}
{"translation": "\"No one supports me, no one does anything for me.\""}
{"translation": "Someone else, someone else."}
{"translation": "I'll tell you a story about our volunteers."}
{"translation": "This volunteer, Wang Yin, is a Shanghai man at the age of 30."}
{"translation": "She became our first volunteer for \"100 Days of Smile\"."}
{"translation": "\"Smiling 100 Days\" is what we've got volunteers to do in poor mountain areas to help children read happily."}
{"translation": "It's been there for 100 days."}
{"translation": "She's going to Guizhou, a very remote place, where there's no car."}
{"translation": "She's not well, she's weak, she has to walk the mountain every day."}
{"translation": "When she had this idea, she told her family that she could have known her family's opposition."}
{"translation": "Please see a video."}
{"translation": "She's there. I'm sure they'd like to know if her mother was there for her at the end."}
{"translation": "When she got to Guizhou, her mother couldn't really get over it."}
{"translation": "Her mother's friend said to her mother, she said, \"You're lucky that your child has a dream and can do such a bitter thing; my own son, all the roads have been arranged with him, but he's not happy, and eventually he's depressed.\""}
{"translation": "When she wakes up, her mother says to Wang Yin, \"Be safe, and do what you like to do.\""}
{"translation": "More than that, when Wang Yin arrived in Guizhou, many of her friends heard that she was volunteering."}
{"translation": "He's been calling for money at her house, charging her cell phone, telling her, \"We can't go, I hope you'll have fun with the kids for us.\""}
{"translation": "Indeed, all those who oppose are constantly helping us to think about what the real meaning of our actions is."}
{"translation": "You need someone else's support, and it's not because you're handsome and pretty, because you live up to the meaning of what you really do."}
{"translation": "So as long as you act, as long as you prove your direction right with your actions, you will naturally have a lot of people to support you."}
{"translation": "This is a situation."}
{"translation": "There's another situation."}
{"translation": "This volunteer, Wu Hae-gang, is from Malaysia."}
{"translation": "Ten years ago, he watched a public service ad on television and told a story about a Western tutor."}
{"translation": "He's particularly touched."}
{"translation": "He thinks I'm going to Yunnan to be a teacher."}
{"translation": "He told his wife at the time that she was against it."}
{"translation": "The family objected, \"That's the age. Don't mess with it. Protect yourself.\""}
{"translation": "And then he didn't know where to find a channel for such a teaching, and he said, \"Okay, just wait.\""}
{"translation": "After 10 years, he thought I couldn't wait any longer."}
{"translation": "He said to me, \"I'm getting closer and closer to the other end of my life, and I may not be able to wait any longer.\""}
{"translation": "He's done something since last year."}
{"translation": "What's going on?"}
{"translation": "He told everyone, \"I have this dream. I'm going to Yunnan to teach. Who can help me?\""}
{"translation": "A friend of mine introduced him to me, and he came to me and said, \"Chang Ning, I want to teach.\""}
{"translation": "I said, \"Why do you want to teach?\""}
{"translation": "He said, \"Ah, I'm from China, but I think I'm Chinese."}
{"translation": "I want to immigrate to Yunnan to be with the child so that they can receive a fair education.\u201d"}
{"translation": "I was deeply touched by his words."}
{"translation": "I said, \"Well, I didn't do a side project, but you touched me, and I helped you.\""}
{"translation": "I've found four other public service institutions, a smiling library, a dedicated library, a public English library, and Yongning."}
{"translation": "Together with Brother Kong, we planned such a wonderful volunteer project called \"100 Days of Smile\" according to his needs."}
{"translation": "They go, let the children go into the ocean of books, make them really like them in a happy way."}
{"translation": "The teachers told us that you really helped the kids and helped us ease the burden."}
{"translation": "Volunteers are happy, teachers are happy, children are happier."}
{"translation": "I've told four stories before."}
{"translation": "Didn't you see that there was actually one thing in common?"}
{"translation": "When we have ideas, when we are ready to act, we have nothing."}
{"translation": "We didn't say I gave you the money, we didn't say we went with you, but we did."}
{"translation": "Because we know that action will bring us everything we want."}
{"translation": "Wang Yin said a very good word."}
{"translation": "She said, \"I've had a lot of bad times in my life, but I'm going to Yunnan and Guizhou very well.\""}
{"translation": "What's the matter?"}
{"translation": "She said, \"As soon as I left, I found myself like a solid-energy succulent, and all the resources came towards me.\""}
{"translation": "I am very pleased today that the host of the two stories was invited to the scene."}
{"translation": "Welcome to Wang Yin and Kong."}
{"translation": "Well, hello, everybody."}
{"translation": "I'd like to say, \"I want each of us to find the path of light in our hearts, to take firm steps. Let's go!\""}
{"translation": "\u201cAnd tomorrow it will be yesterday, and now it will be.\u201d"}
{"translation": "\"Let's move now!\""}
