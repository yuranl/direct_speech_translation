{"translation": "Let's start with marriage."}
{"translation": "At a great wedding, the bride's mother made a very strong and long statement to the bride and groom on the stage."}
{"translation": "She said, \u201cThe two of you come from different places and have different life habits, and now you form a family, and then you need to know that the future will do what you do to your children, and you need to know that the true meaning of this marriage is to accommodate each other, and that the marriage is 0.5 + 0.5 = 1.\u201d"}
{"translation": "After that, the guests here may have listened to it as you have said, and you will say, \"Oh, this experience of years of this marriage has found the truth of the marriage.\""}
{"translation": "But wait a minute. Is this really true?"}
{"translation": "Is real marriage 0.5 + 0.5 = 1?"}
{"translation": "I was supposed to be a full one."}
{"translation": "If inclusion means turning 1 into 0.5, why should I enter into marriage in a society where we can live without marriage?"}
{"translation": "So our intimate relationship study tells you that 0.5 + 0.5 = 1 is a product of a process in which we used to treat marriage as the ultimate goal of old age that could not be broken."}
{"translation": "But what we think is important today is that I want to be happy and grow up in marriage."}
{"translation": "So good intimacy must be 1+1 greater than 1 equal."}
{"translation": "But there's nothing wrong with this mother, because we do have to face all kinds of differences."}
{"translation": "For example, men and women, uh, parents are different from our children."}
{"translation": "One of our women's favorite games is a guess game."}
{"translation": "After many years of married life, our gentleman on our birthdays will ask us, \"Oh, what gift do you want this year?\""}
{"translation": "We said, \"Whatever.\""}
{"translation": "We'll never tell him because we have to guess."}
{"translation": "Our husband often doesn't understand. He'll always be wrong."}
{"translation": "We are disappointed, because the highest level of love in our minds is that I say nothing about you knowing me, which means that you love me."}
{"translation": "But a man is an animal and he's strange, and he doesn't think like that."}
{"translation": "He said you didn't say anything about how I could know. I'm not a bug in your belly."}
{"translation": "So in marital life, because of this difference, it's in a long-term marriage."}
{"translation": "I'm hurt because we think you don't understand me. How can you do that? I don't think you love me."}
{"translation": "Marriage becomes bridal, so the problem of difference has to be solved by us."}
{"translation": "So I do anthropology myself, and I actually think that Mr. Fah-tung, when he's doing he's doing he's doing he's actually summing up a few words from his national studies, and I think it's the best interpretation of differences."}
{"translation": "It's called \"The beauty of the beauty, the beauty of the beauty, the beauty of the life of the world.\""}
{"translation": "He came up with it in ethnology, and his philosophy is, \"Well, every nation has its own standards, values and aesthetics."}
{"translation": "This value orientation and aesthetic standards are often wrong and even disgusting in the eyes of another people."}
{"translation": "So in the early days of national contact, it was often a powerful people who forced another people to adapt to me."}
{"translation": "In the process, ethnic conflicts continue to erupt, and there is no way in which people can live in harmony with each other."}
{"translation": "And at this point, we'll find, uh, after a lot of people's contact, we'll find out that your beauty and your values are different from mine, but it makes sense."}
{"translation": "In more exchanges, we'll find that it's not just that, but that one day I found out that your dances, your religious beliefs, are something that I would love."}
{"translation": "Then we continue to communicate with this further understanding, and we have reached the United States and the United States, and we begin to appreciate that difference."}
{"translation": "It is because of that difference and pluralism that we find the world so beautiful."}
{"translation": "Then we can truly achieve the harmonious society that our party leadership has proposed."}
{"translation": "This idea is used in family life, but it is exactly the same."}
{"translation": "It's just hard to say it's easy to do."}
{"translation": "Let us give a few examples."}
{"translation": "This one may have been recognized at first sight. This is our most famous hero of last year's pit daddy incident."}
{"translation": "But he was a very good young man, and his artistic talents were very, very good."}
{"translation": "His father, Li Zhejiang, once told me about his talent in an appointment."}
{"translation": "Ah, proud to say, I always wanted my child to grow free, and I wanted him to have the energy of love."}
{"translation": "I let him grow free so he could perform so well."}
{"translation": "He said that his mother was often demanding from him, and I told him that you were wrong and that the child could only develop his artistic talents if he was free to do so."}
{"translation": "But one day, when Li Tianichi had a lot of things to do, we started to say that you were wrong because you were wrong, so he put you in a trap because you were too fond of your children."}
{"translation": "But we look back."}
{"translation": "Isn't it right to allow a child to develop freely?"}
{"translation": "We know that when a child grows up, he needs to know what the rules are, and someone needs to be very strict about what you should do, and that these rules must be respected."}
{"translation": "But at the same time, he also needs to give him space to grow freely."}
{"translation": "Both education is actually needed for a child."}
{"translation": "So it's not that love must be bad, it's not that strict education must be bad."}
{"translation": "It's not good to walk in extremes."}
{"translation": "But for a child, both types of education are needed."}
{"translation": "These two differences must coexist in a manner that does not wipe each other out and criticize each other."}
{"translation": "But this is the idea of beauty."}
{"translation": "We want the difference to exist because it has always been justified."}
{"translation": "But it's hard to do it, and I find it hard to do it myself."}
{"translation": "I'll tell you my own story."}
{"translation": "My kids got a math test when they went to elementary school, and I saw that they had 80 points in their school, and she didn't get 80 points."}
{"translation": "Then I'll say to the kid, \"Hey, baby, let's analyze why you're wrong. Do we have any way of correcting these mistakes?\""}
{"translation": "Ah, I'm very happy. I think I'm doing very well."}
{"translation": "Because I am an expert in this area, I did not criticize her."}
{"translation": "That's when my husband came back."}
{"translation": "He said, \"Well, math is my specialty. Show me the kids' papers.\""}
{"translation": "He said, \"Oh, what's wrong with this one, it's careless, it's not a mistake.\""}
{"translation": "\"What's wrong with the title and what's wrong with it? Can you count it right? You can count it right. It's not a mistake.\""}
{"translation": "And lastly, he said you did 99 points."}
{"translation": "Ah, that's what I thought. How can you let the kid know she's wrong?"}
{"translation": "But I also know it's wrong to say that the two of us are different and can't say it in front of the kids."}
{"translation": "Wait a minute, let me see the effect."}
{"translation": "As a result, our children's math scores have been going up."}
{"translation": "Because she's confident, and she thinks every time it's wrong, well, I can actually do better."}
{"translation": "At that moment, she needed both ways, but perhaps more importantly, confidence."}
{"translation": "So, I find this beauty to mean that people are different from you, and he's probably right."}
{"translation": "It's like we're different when we're in love and we're married."}
{"translation": "We found out before we got married that our husband was such a generous man, with brothers and friends; after we got married, we said why you didn't take care of your family and why you had so many things to do outside."}
{"translation": "It's just a feature that happens in different contexts."}
{"translation": "Before we got married, we found Mrs. Birdie, you listen to everything, and you're very pretty, and you're very happy; after we get married, you'll find out why this woman is so unable to do anything, and you're tired of depending on you."}
{"translation": "It's also a feature in different contexts."}
{"translation": "So the beauty of beauty is to say more about seeing that virtue."}
{"translation": "It's really hard for you to change a person because it's a characteristic thing."}
{"translation": "You just see what he's got, so he's often more likely to happen in the right areas."}
{"translation": "In practice, however, there are more benefits to be gained from differences."}
{"translation": "I've been living in America for a long time."}
{"translation": "Well, I'm not good at driving because I'm blind, and I know this traffic in America is very good, but I never thought I'd be driving."}
{"translation": "For me, that car on the American highway was a pretty scary thing."}
{"translation": "But last year, in October 2002, I went to Los Angeles with my husband for five days."}
{"translation": "Two days in the middle he said he was going to San Francisco once."}
{"translation": "As far as I'm concerned, that doesn't make it possible for the plane to fly."}
{"translation": "He said no, he had to rent a car to drive."}
{"translation": "Seven hours from Los Angeles to San Francisco, 14 hours back and forth."}
{"translation": "It's horrible for me to call back and forth in two days, 14 hours."}
{"translation": "I said no, I'm not going, but my husband says I'm going."}
{"translation": "Because he was with me in America, and he was with me for a meeting, and I guess he was with me, so I made a compromise, and then we rented a car to get on the road."}
{"translation": "As a result, I found the road from Los Angeles to San Francisco so beautiful and beautiful."}
{"translation": "It gives me a particularly unique feeling."}
{"translation": "My husband also told me in the car that he understood life in the United States, and I felt that some of your dreams were like this."}
{"translation": "Without my husband, without his differences with me, with my life, I would never have had such an attempt, and I would never have found that beautiful."}
{"translation": "But because of him, he's not like me, so I'm starting to have two worlds."}
{"translation": "When we encounter problems, there are two solutions."}
{"translation": "We give the kids two ways to say it."}
{"translation": "You get into any problem, Mom says, \"Well, that's what you can do, Dad says that's what you can do.\""}
{"translation": "The kid said, well, you two have to combine the two ways to see what's better."}
{"translation": "Our lives are uniquely good and particularly interesting because of differences."}
{"translation": "This is the beauty of beauty after beauty."}
{"translation": "Well, at this level, we'll find out that the true intimacy is not about love, not about me being unable to live without you."}
{"translation": "It's just that I can live well without you."}
{"translation": "But I'm better off with you, and I feel better with myself, because you're better with me."}
{"translation": "At this point, the positive energy of intimate relationships can be fully realized."}
{"translation": "Because it is only when there is the power of love in intimate relationships that we are willing to deal with these differences."}
{"translation": "It is only when we continue to collide in intimate relationships that we know that the bottom line is here, that the compromise is here."}
{"translation": "The beauty was here, the harmonious relationship was there."}
{"translation": "We live here, and at the same time we can feel the wonderful view of the other side."}
{"translation": "From now on, let us learn to respect differences, enjoy differences, feel diverse and enjoy a good life."}
{"translation": "Thank you!"}
