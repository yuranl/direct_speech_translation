{"translation": "Hello, everyone."}
{"translation": "I'm Chen Shauqi. I'm a musician from Hong Kong."}
{"translation": "I hope you can give me some applause."}
{"translation": "Yeah, it's actually my heart too."}
{"translation": "Because if I don't talk well later,"}
{"translation": "At the very least, the sponsors can get some applause to cut back."}
{"translation": "Ah, the title of what I'm going to share with you today is \"Creative History.\""}
{"translation": "It's actually me who's been walking all the way to the altar for the last 32 years."}
{"translation": "And then there's something about writing, and I'd like to share it with you."}
{"translation": "It'll be divided into four parts."}
{"translation": "The first part is the path of creation."}
{"translation": "That's what I've been doing from 1985 until now, trying to tell you who I am."}
{"translation": "The second part is that in addition to the creation of music, there are other artistic creations of my own, including photography, and then, uh, painting and so on."}
{"translation": "And the third part is some of the tools that I've used, some of the tools that I've used, some of the methods that I've done, and I'd like to share with you."}
{"translation": "And finally, it's an attitude of slow life and creativity."}
{"translation": "Ah, it's split into these parts."}
{"translation": "This is going to take a few more seconds."}
{"translation": "Because I've been here 32 years."}
{"translation": "Some of the people who saw my name today still think I'm a woman."}
{"translation": "Yeah, so I'll play it again."}
{"translation": "The first part: The path of creation."}
{"translation": "I'm a luckier man."}
{"translation": "In 1984, in 85, I was with two friends, Liu Yiddha and Huang Yiming, who were trying to combine a man's music."}
{"translation": "And then I asked myself to write them some lyrics."}
{"translation": "And then we'll go through it for about a year or two."}
{"translation": "He did a lot of demo and a lot of little things and sent them to all the big, big, big record companies."}
{"translation": "And soon they were also admired by that record company, and signed to become artists under the flag."}
{"translation": "And then we changed our name to \"Daming One.\""}
{"translation": "And then there was the song, the lyrics, the music, the music, the music, the music, the music, the music, the music, the music, the music, the music, the music, the music, the music, the music, the music, the music, the music, the music, the music, the music, the music, the music, the music, the music, the music, the music, the music, the music, the music, the music, the music, the music, the music, the music, the music, the music, the music, the music, the music, the music, the music, the music, the music, the music, the music, the music."}
{"translation": "In nominal terms, it was a little bit of a little bit of a shock, because they were a bit ahead of the stage at the time."}
{"translation": "I'm lucky, too. That's why."}
{"translation": "It was quickly noticed by a lot of former singers."}
{"translation": "I was invited to write songs for Tan, Zhang Kuo-young, Mei Yan-Fang and Zhang's students very soon."}
{"translation": "And then, uh, 10, 15, 20 years."}
{"translation": "I've written about two or three thousand lyrics in Hong Kong."}
{"translation": "And slowly moving from being a lyricist to being a er, uh, producer of a concert and planning to include songs, album producers, projects, and so on."}
{"translation": "Until 2005, there was a turning point or turning point in my career. What was it?"}
{"translation": "At the time, the music in the interior began to fly."}
{"translation": "And then a lot of people invited me to Beijing and Shanghai to do some music cases."}
{"translation": "And then there was a bit of an imbalance in my heart."}
{"translation": "What's the imbalance?"}
{"translation": "I was searching the 100-degree music list."}
{"translation": "The first 100 songs in Cantonese are probably only ten and eight, perhaps even fewer."}
{"translation": "And sometimes one month, two months, six months without my work."}
{"translation": "Ah, then I'll search the first 500 classics."}
{"translation": "With my work, it's probably some of the eighties and ninetys, uh, some of the classic Cantonese songs."}
{"translation": "That's when I thought, \"Well, I'm not going to hit this market again.\""}
{"translation": "This is a market I'm not familiar with at all."}
{"translation": "I was 40, and it seemed too old to start over, too early to retire."}
{"translation": "So I didn't give up. I didn't give up."}
{"translation": "I then set up a workshop in Beijing by 0607."}
{"translation": "And fortunately, I've been involved in some big public service songs, including the Olympics of '08, the U.S. Expo of 2010 and some songs."}
{"translation": "And then, fortunately, in '08, I wrote a non-theme song for the film \"The Heart.\""}
{"translation": "And it's a lot of, uh, attention to, uh, awards and so on."}
{"translation": "Uh, from '08 to the next 10 years of this year, I've done a lot of uh cases in my studio except for songs."}
{"translation": "Some even have nothing to do with music."}
{"translation": "Or even ads, spokespersons, or speaking er, acting er, acting concerts er, or filming MVs."}
{"translation": "Ah, there's a lot of cooperation with Disney."}
{"translation": "Ah, including the opening of their garden in, uh, 1 or 16 years, I co-authored a Shanghai theme song from the Uh Disneyland, in cooperation with Ms. Tan."}
{"translation": "Well, in all kinds of music projects, the only way I'm in love with a single act is actually a musical."}
{"translation": "In 1997, I was a writer for the music show \"Lake of the Snow Wolf\" by my friend Zhang, and probably a quarter of the lyrics, and I wrote a song."}
{"translation": "Then last year, 2017, was the twentieth anniversary of the Wolf Lake."}
{"translation": "And then I helped Mr. Ma Yong-seong, a very good cartoonist in Hong Kong, with the musical \"The Clouds\" for the opera's lyrics."}
{"translation": "I'm sure you've seen it in Windy Clouds."}
{"translation": "And then last year's production made me realize a lot of new technologies."}
{"translation": "On the stage, including water, fire, lots and lots of new projects, those new forms of production."}
{"translation": "At the end of this year, I'm supposed to be following up on my first personal musical, called Love in Starlight, developed in collaboration with the Hae Weng and Guang."}
{"translation": "In fact, \"starlight\" is a double-barrel meaning."}
{"translation": "It's a neighborhood that looks like a canteen."}
{"translation": "Then why am I the only one in all kinds of musical performances that I have a crush on?"}
{"translation": "So the second part actually explains that."}
{"translation": "Cross-border art."}
{"translation": "From the moment I was born, I felt that I had the gift of seeing pictures, and seeing a story, and it was very easy for me to translate it into a very simple, uh, text."}
{"translation": "And then the year I was 10 years old."}
{"translation": "I could even turn that into a lyrics."}
{"translation": "Then I was in junior high."}
{"translation": "I often turn some English-English songs into Chinese songs and write a lot of different lyrics."}
{"translation": "And then, uh, when I graduated from high school, I went to college as a graphic design."}
{"translation": "So it's slowly turning into photography, even painting, and even then I like to do that model, which is a three-dimensional, uh, stereo thing."}
{"translation": "It's that I see a lot of different experiences in life, and I like to turn it into a work of creation."}
{"translation": "Uh, these are some of the pictures I used to take with pictures and films."}
{"translation": "Well, it's the luckiest thing I've ever done is work with an artist."}
{"translation": "Because every time I taped them, I filmed MVs and made ads."}
{"translation": "I actually came to the scene and I wanted to do something real, but I really liked it when I asked them to be my model and let me do it."}
{"translation": "Uh, it doesn't matter if they want it or not."}
{"translation": "So you should know how they feel when you look at their helpless eyes and their eyes."}
{"translation": "But that's what they respect me for, because they know I love it."}
{"translation": "And there's painting."}
{"translation": "Ah, sketch is the kind of uh, uh, performance I really like."}
{"translation": "Ah, I think this image of black and white gives me something that's very clean, emotionally stable and deposited."}
{"translation": "And then, uh, these things up here, they're one of the tasks I've always given myself."}
{"translation": "When I was on a plane, if it was a very short flight, in about two or three hours, I'd have to draw a picture."}
{"translation": "So when you see me, sometimes you look for magazines, airline magazines, and I do it all in two or two hours."}
{"translation": "But the one at the bottom left, the one at the bottom of the left, is a sketch."}
{"translation": "It's a fine sketch."}
{"translation": "These are sketches, and each one takes 100 hours."}
{"translation": "It could take two or three hours each day."}
{"translation": "Go home and paint for a few hours after work."}
{"translation": "Then it will take one month, two months, and some even six months to complete."}
{"translation": "So it's all texture, water, hair, one by one."}
{"translation": "I've been through this process and I've been able to talk to my heart, and I think I've had more time to go and think about all that."}
{"translation": "That's because art is connected. Art is connected."}
{"translation": "I've been asked by a lot of people. How does it work?"}
{"translation": "I would then like to introduce the third part."}
{"translation": "That's what I used to do. I used to do it all the time."}
{"translation": "Ah, imbalance, asymmetrical, uh, contrast, and also elevate, that's some of the techniques I've often used."}
{"translation": "The first is simple."}
{"translation": "In fact, it's imbalance, asymmetry, imbalance from the picture, like the size of objects, before and after."}
{"translation": "Uh, the one in the upper right corner, for example."}
{"translation": "A cyclist faces thousands of people."}
{"translation": "The picture is asymmetrical and unbalanced."}
{"translation": "There's also the contrast, the contrast is the color contrast."}
{"translation": "It's like the top left corner."}
{"translation": "And then that right."}
{"translation": "The contrast between Leung Wing Chi's black and white and a red color."}
{"translation": "The sketch at the bottom left is also a color contrast."}
{"translation": "Ah, I'd like to mention that there's a slogan on the side of that soda can. I made it myself."}
{"translation": "Maybe you can't see it."}
{"translation": "\"love our Earth like it's your heart,\" is to love our planet like we love our own hearts."}
{"translation": "Look at the word \"arth.\""}
{"translation": "If you move that last letter H to the front, it'll turn into heart."}
{"translation": "That's the line I came up with."}
{"translation": "And that's what I'm talking about."}
{"translation": "And then a lot of people say that art is a kind of elevate in life."}
{"translation": "And then what's uplifting?"}
{"translation": "What I'd like to share is, if you see something that's very ordinary and feels very uncharacteristic, do you have the ability to see something different?"}
{"translation": "Because I'm very fond of adapting a model."}
{"translation": "Change something quite normal and ordinary and turn it into something extraordinary, uh."}
{"translation": "For example, this camera stands up, and then I see that look, and I find it interesting, and I see that I can change it to something."}
{"translation": "Then I'll buy it back, open it, and then paint it, color it, turn it into a ship, and add some very militarized parts."}
{"translation": "And then it's also a map, and then it turns into something like a poster."}
{"translation": "Then the most important thing is the lower right corner, back to the point where it can still be photographed."}
{"translation": "It's also a normal stand-up."}
{"translation": "It's also a kind of life inspiration, and it's a kind of elevate."}
{"translation": "Uh, this is what I used to do with that draft."}
{"translation": "It's been a long time."}
{"translation": "Well, some parts are slowly being collected and some models are being collected, but there's no time to do them."}
{"translation": "I've been trying to turn a Mini's car into that helicopter."}
{"translation": "I have a friend, he's a parent, he's a parent."}
{"translation": "He asked me one day and said,"}
{"translation": "Ah Shige, you've got so much interest, so much work."}
{"translation": "So how do you think it's gonna be possible to train his kids with a little bit of comparison, some focus, some interest?"}
{"translation": "Then I asked him a question."}
{"translation": "I asked him, in addition to buying him the latest cell phone, the latest computer, and, uh, the notebooks, did you train some of his work, some things, some tasks, like a month, six months or more?"}
{"translation": "He looked at me and said, no."}
{"translation": "Then I say, you hurry up and do it."}
{"translation": "New media, high technology, AI."}
{"translation": "If you want your kids to fight this age, you have to look different in it."}
{"translation": "Then you should give him some cell phones and notebooks and train him some of his works and tasks that take a long, long time to complete."}
{"translation": "Because there are fewer and fewer people who can do this."}
{"translation": "That's the first thing I told him about, the art of excellence."}
{"translation": "The second lift is."}
{"translation": "There is too much too much information now."}
{"translation": "Every day we look at the cell phone, we look at the micro-mails, we see the good things, we see the bad things, we get the things that we have, we get the things that we don't have, we get the things that we get, and it's easy to get them."}
{"translation": "So I gave him the idea of trying to get his judgmental skills up to the level of aesthetics."}
{"translation": "What is it?"}
{"translation": "It's that we don't take time to criticize something bad or to scold someone we don't know."}
{"translation": "In turn, we will only spend time appreciating what we think is good, and spending time boasting about what we think is good."}
{"translation": "It'll make you, uh, the aesthetic standard. It's purer."}
{"translation": "The last part I want to share is hard work and slow life."}
{"translation": "There's a popular word called \"slow work.\""}
{"translation": "Many think that slowness is a very loose life."}
{"translation": "Uh, sitting in a caf\u00e9 for three hours is slow, not in my definition."}
{"translation": "It's really hard work to slow down."}
{"translation": "You just saw me do a lot of work, a lot of work."}
{"translation": "Allow me to be arrogant."}
{"translation": "It's me, too, and I'm, uh, even interested in something, and I'm a hard-working person."}
{"translation": "Because you don't just spend hundreds of hours drawing a couple of paintings and make models."}
{"translation": "It's not about making money."}
{"translation": "I'd like to share what's really the golden age in Hong Kong."}
{"translation": "In fact, average artists, usually creators, were also very diligent, including formerly Chang Kuo Ying and Mei Ying Fung."}
{"translation": "Uh, I won't say it today."}
{"translation": "Because they're stories you've probably heard."}
{"translation": "For example, Mae Fung used to be in the park."}
{"translation": "At the age of seven and eight, you have to practice and sing and dance every day."}
{"translation": "It's only then that it becomes the end of the world on the stage."}
{"translation": "This is my slow and slow life."}
{"translation": "That's what I'm trying to tell you in a way that I'm living, that's what I'm saying, that's unbalanced, that's asymmetric."}
{"translation": "Why?"}
{"translation": "I've been listening to black glue records so far, it's very inefficient."}
{"translation": "Because mobile phones can find thousands of songs and tens of thousands of songs."}
{"translation": "But I'm still going to love listening to black glue. It's very inefficient."}
{"translation": "You have to flip that record every 15 minutes."}
{"translation": "Shoot, film, film pictures."}
{"translation": "Cycling retrofit."}
{"translation": "It's easy to drive all kinds of cars now, but I'm still like, uh, remodeled bikes."}
{"translation": "Every day we go to find parts around the world online."}
{"translation": "It's not expensive at all. It's just a matter of time."}
{"translation": "And this is through this process, and I'm slowly feeling a lot about everything I own."}
{"translation": "Ah, more and more of that stuff."}
{"translation": "Because now we're in the new media, and all the new times, everything is out of our minds."}
{"translation": "I'll get it soon. I'll forget it soon."}
{"translation": "So through this slow life, let me value more what I can get."}
{"translation": "Uh, I've been enjoying a model for a house lately."}
{"translation": "I'm building a train model at home."}
{"translation": "It's about getting a small city out of Japan."}
{"translation": "That's the kind of thing that takes time."}
{"translation": "You and you make a house, it takes, uh, a long time to finish one."}
{"translation": "So I'm on tape with a very new generation of artists who work with singers."}
{"translation": "I told them that diligence is a necessary attitude for you to survive in this circle."}
{"translation": "Except that wrapper, except for the man."}
{"translation": "Your attitude to life is a necessary condition to keep you young."}
{"translation": "For years now, popular art and popular culture have developed."}
{"translation": "It's really hard to make what we call creation from scratch, from scratch to nothing, to invent a new vehicle, to invent a new tune, or something."}
{"translation": "It's good to be able to do it."}
{"translation": "So, even if you're going to be young, you're going to have to work hard."}
{"translation": "And then as a summary for today."}
{"translation": "Uh, I'd like to tell you the story behind a song."}
{"translation": "This song is about the honor of Zhang."}
{"translation": "Because April is the season of the memory of Zhang Guofang."}
{"translation": "And then, in 1990, Zhang Guofeng decided to quit the altar."}
{"translation": "One night, we had dinner in Hong Kong in a central restaurant."}
{"translation": "And then he mentioned, uh, that there was an idea that he wanted to quit playing."}
{"translation": "And then I told him that your famous work was called \"The Wind Continues\" \"The Wind Continues.\""}
{"translation": "And then I wanted not to write a song about the wind."}
{"translation": "Just let your fans make you think about you when the wind blows?"}
{"translation": "It's called \"The Wind Back.\""}
