{"translation": "Hello, everyone!"}
{"translation": "Uh, it is a great pleasure today to have the opportunity to share with you the theme of beauty and science."}
{"translation": "Not pretty science. Of course we're talking about pretty girls."}
{"translation": "The aesthetics that can't be applied to beautiful women are hypocritical, so we need to get this right."}
{"translation": "So what I'm saying today is to share two parts: the first is the science of the beauty, the science of the beauty; the second is the beauty of the science, the beauty of the science."}
{"translation": "The 25th of November was the most beautiful day for me."}
{"translation": "Why is it beautiful?"}
{"translation": "Two reasons."}
{"translation": "One reason is that Einstein published a broad theory of relativity 100 years ago on this day, so it is the most beautiful scientific theory for me."}
{"translation": "Another reason you can see is that the most beautiful girl in the world was born 25 years ago, my daughter."}
{"translation": "What's the commonality between the beauty of my daughter and the beauty of general relativity?"}
{"translation": "What's the science in this?"}
{"translation": "This is what I want to share with you today."}
{"translation": "In other words, we ask one question: what is beauty?"}
{"translation": "So the question has actually been asked by philosophers for more than 2,000 years, starting with the great philosopher Socrates to his student Plato, and by his student Aristotle, to the present philosophers Kandeh, Hegel and so on."}
{"translation": "This question is referred to as the follow-up of geniuses."}
{"translation": "So let's see what the philosophers are asking for for more than 2,000 years now."}
{"translation": "Then, of course, there are very many kinds of answers."}
{"translation": "We have chosen the alumni's views on this issue, as summarized by Professor Julien of the University of Tanya."}
{"translation": "Professor Chu said that I didn't think I could answer that question, but Plato said that beauty is difficult, so beauty is difficult."}
{"translation": "And Professor Chu goes on to say that I think it's a very good word."}
{"translation": "Beauty is what, beauty is hard."}
{"translation": "I'd say beauty is a woman."}
{"translation": "If we're in class, then when I was speaking, I, uh, when I was speaking, for example, with Anne today, asked me questions and asked me, \"Dear Professor, how high is the sun?\""}
{"translation": "Then I teach astronomy, and that's the right question."}
{"translation": "And I said, \"Dear classmate, how true am I?\""}
{"translation": "And then, \"How many stars are there in the sky?\""}
{"translation": "And I went on to say, \"There's a lot of N-N-N.\""}
{"translation": "You may recall that we had a beautiful woman, Yang Xiao, who sings a very similar song."}
{"translation": "So if I answer the same question in the same way, I'm sure Ann's going out there crying in the bathroom."}
{"translation": "So that's the typical answer."}
{"translation": "It seems to me that the answer to beauty is difficult and a little more like that."}
{"translation": "So, what's beauty?"}
{"translation": "Beautiful is difficult."}
{"translation": "As far as you're concerned, I don't believe it."}
{"translation": "Why?"}
{"translation": "Because it's not science."}
{"translation": "Why not science?"}
{"translation": "The answer is not our custom."}
{"translation": "At the bottom of the question is the natural role of scientists, and we would like to answer that question."}
{"translation": "So how am I supposed to think about this?"}
{"translation": "Actually, I've been thinking about it for almost 30 years."}
{"translation": "I need a natural science approach to aesthetics."}
{"translation": "We have a famous physicist, Mr. Peng Qingwu, who said, \u201cThe material world, though changing, is very sincere, and `the same phenomenon is inevitable under the same conditions'\u201d."}
{"translation": "So I'm going to apply Mr. Peng's words to aesthetic research."}
{"translation": "I would like to say that the beauty of the world, while constantly changing, and the variety of beautiful women present are very different, should have an inherent pattern."}
{"translation": "So, if I actually do it, I'll start with the problem."}
{"translation": "Mr. Einstein taught us that it is not only Einstein who taught us general relativity, but also scientific research methods."}
{"translation": "He said that it was more important to ask a good question than to solve an N problem."}
{"translation": "What's beautiful?"}
{"translation": "I think there's a different way to say that."}
{"translation": "My formulation is to say, in a broad sense, that aesthetic objects can include beauty, which may include beauty, which may include food, or fine art, which art, which science which may include beauty, what standards do they meet?"}
{"translation": "In other words, what are the criteria for judgment in the broad sense of beauty?"}
{"translation": "I turned this into a problem."}
{"translation": "In other words, if the criteria for judgment in the broad sense of beauty are established, we can understand \u201cwhat is beauty\u201d or \u201cwhat is beauty\u201d."}
{"translation": "Of course, the broad beauty criterion is academic, and I call it the broad beauty rule, so I am trying to build a broad beauty rule."}
{"translation": "What about the specifics?"}
{"translation": "I am a three-part approach that follows our comparative standards for natural science research."}
{"translation": "If we look at steps, we are, in particular, a three-part approach."}
{"translation": "First of all, we need to sum up."}
{"translation": "We need to bring out the different types of beauty according to what we do, and we want to sum up the rule that commonality is beautiful."}
{"translation": "Then we have to prove it."}
{"translation": "That is to say, to give more examples and to try to find out, as much as possible, whether what we think is beautiful is contrary to our rules."}
{"translation": "If not, we will change that rule in violation of that rule."}
{"translation": "Then we have to testify."}
{"translation": "We need to find out what we feel is not in keeping with that rule in order to do the opposite."}
{"translation": "In that case, I finally got the law of broad beauty."}
{"translation": "This broad rule of beauty is \u201cno flaws, not common.\u201d"}
{"translation": "If we meet both conditions, we'll feel beautiful."}
{"translation": "\u201cThere are no flaws\u201d for values."}
{"translation": "For example, they are powerful, natural, reasonable, complete, true and good."}
{"translation": "It's common, of course, to say something different, different, excellent, air, etc., but it's also very common to say that it's natural, urban, imitating, bouncing, etc."}
{"translation": "The man in this room, if you put any of my \"common\" entries on your girlfriend or your wife, I promise she'll strangle you if she doesn't kill you."}
{"translation": "So beautiful judgment is in this place."}
{"translation": "What's a aesthetic?"}
{"translation": "Why do we have different aesthetics?"}
{"translation": "The aesthetics are the ability to judge beauty, the values to judge whether there are flaws, and then our insights to judge whether they are not common."}
{"translation": "So different values, coupled with our different perspectives, lead us to different aesthetics."}
{"translation": "It's beautiful for the same thing, for object, for man, for anyone who thinks that there are no defects and no one who is not."}
{"translation": "When you feel like there's nothing wrong with it, you feel beautiful."}
{"translation": "Since when do you think it's common for you to think it's not beautiful?"}
{"translation": "So there is no objective beauty, no absolute beauty, no universal beauty, no eternal beauty."}
{"translation": "Beauty is always changing."}
{"translation": "Let me give you one example below."}
{"translation": "This is one of the things I put in my circle of friends yesterday."}
{"translation": "We know that the weather in Beijing was good the other day."}
{"translation": "All of us put blue clouds in the circle of our friends."}
{"translation": "I posted the morning Xia and the clouds yesterday."}
{"translation": "And I said, \"It's still hot, it's hot, it's blue, it's white, but why doesn't anyone say it's beautiful today?\""}
{"translation": "Because the clouds have been blue and white for some time now, and although there are no flaws, they are no longer uncommon, so they don't look beautiful."}
{"translation": "So I said, \"O mist, gently tell me when you'll end your vacation.\""}
{"translation": "I asked such a question."}
{"translation": "Then there was a comment, and a friend said, \u201cIf a scientific philosopher sees this, it must be high enough to say that scientists come to sacrifice everyone's health in order to prove his aesthetic theory\u201d."}
{"translation": "I quickly replied that I said it wasn't like that."}
{"translation": "I replied that I would rather have the common blue sky and no health defects than the common ones."}
{"translation": "Then a friend went on to comment that this comment was even worse."}
{"translation": "He said, \"How's the weather today?\""}
{"translation": "So that's what happens when you don't make friends."}
{"translation": "One more example."}
{"translation": "This is Mr. Ho, my mentor."}
{"translation": "And the beauty of the autumn of the Qinghua Garden, and I say it is also the beauty of beauty."}
{"translation": "I put this in my circle of friends on November 22nd."}
{"translation": "Two events took place on 22 November."}
{"translation": "One thing was a commemorative meeting at Qinghua University to mark the 69th anniversary of the important research work of my mentor, Mr. He Zehui."}
{"translation": "But Mr. Ho died a few years ago."}
{"translation": "Let's see what's in this picture. This little girl on the left is a pretty girl."}
{"translation": "It's a picture of Mr. Ho when he was young."}
{"translation": "Apparently a little beauty."}
{"translation": "On the right is a picture of my mentor, Mr. Ho, in his late years."}
{"translation": "It's still glowing."}
{"translation": "That is why I say that Mr. Ho is a man of high intelligence, high colour and high moral character."}
{"translation": "Such a beautiful woman is the most beautiful."}
{"translation": "It's the same Qinghua Garden. It's the good one. It's the good one. It's the good one."}
{"translation": "And, of course, there's always a better natural environment for autumn."}
{"translation": "The snow scenes are also good, and the first snowmills of each year are good."}
{"translation": "On November 20, there was a snowfall in Beijing."}
{"translation": "But these two things, taken together, are, of course, still without flaws."}
{"translation": "But more importantly, it is not common."}
{"translation": "Autumn snow scenes are not common together."}
{"translation": "The snow melts early and leaves behind the snowfall, which is too late for the fall."}
{"translation": "Autumn snow scenes together are the most beautiful."}
{"translation": "Because there are no flaws, not the usual extremes."}
{"translation": "So on November 20, everyone posted photos in their circle of friends online."}
{"translation": "That's why."}
{"translation": "And it's very rare to have three tall girls, so it's beautiful."}
{"translation": "I give the example that there are no flaws, and it's not usually the most beautiful."}
{"translation": "Here's the beauty of science."}
{"translation": "The science of beauty is clear."}
{"translation": "Here's the beauty of science."}
{"translation": "Scientific exploration, we know, is full of surprises."}
{"translation": "Accidents are, of course, the biggest unusual."}
{"translation": "So I do astronomy myself."}
{"translation": "I use astronomy as an example."}
{"translation": "We know that most of the ground-breaking astronomy research is unexpected."}
{"translation": "I counted it."}
{"translation": "The Institute of Astronomy received about a dozen Nobel Prizes in Physics, only one of which was the result of the plan, the Nobel Prize, and all of which were unexpected and intended to be unexpected."}
{"translation": "Of course, time is limited to just one example, and while I have listed so many, I have only one."}
{"translation": "Ah, this has something to do with pretty girls."}
{"translation": "That's where Ms. Bell found Radio Pulse Star in 1967."}
{"translation": "Let's take a look at this pretty girl. She's a photo of her research, post-graduate."}
{"translation": "All she had to do was study interstellar scintillation, which was known at the time."}
{"translation": "However, she accidentally discovered the radio pulsar, which was the cyclical arrival of the radio transmission."}
{"translation": "And this one on the right was last summer when I met Professor Bell at a meeting in Hawaii last summer."}
{"translation": "I knew her before."}
{"translation": "We talked together."}
{"translation": "We see that Professor Bell is still a shining man."}
{"translation": "So it's also a 3-year-old woman of high color, IQ, and high moral character."}
{"translation": "The three-highest girls in this class are all my goddesses."}
{"translation": "Let me show you a few more pictures, uh, of what we think is a beautiful view."}
{"translation": "The one on the left is a picture of the living, a photograph of a nuclear plate of spores."}
{"translation": "And this one in the middle is a picture of our finger piercing a soap bubble."}
{"translation": "On the right is a picture of a galaxy."}
{"translation": "These pictures are not as beautiful as they are."}
{"translation": "Why is it beautiful?"}
{"translation": "It's natural, so there's no defects, so it's not common for the naked eye to see."}
{"translation": "It happens all the time, but our eyes don't see it, so when we see it, we say it's beautiful."}
{"translation": "Again, this is an issue."}
{"translation": "The same is true of scientific photos."}
{"translation": "Here's the general relativity of Einstein."}
{"translation": "We know that I just spoke of 25 November, a hundred years ago, when Einstein published the most beautiful scientific theory of general relativity."}
{"translation": "Broad relativity is, of course, based on Newton mechanics, which we know he published in 19 1687."}
{"translation": "This theory actually seems very simple today."}
{"translation": "He raised Galileo's inertia to the first and second laws of Newton, plus the third law of Newton, which was the original Newton, and the law of gravity, which was the original Newton."}
{"translation": "Then we can explain the three laws of Kepler."}
{"translation": "So that's the substance of his theory."}
{"translation": "Where's his \"no flaws\"?"}
{"translation": "He explained all the observed and experimental phenomena known at the time."}
{"translation": "Of course, there are no flaws at all."}
{"translation": "\u201cUnusual\u201d is reflected in the scientific theory that is the first quantitative and systematic in human history."}
{"translation": "He had rightly predicted the existence of Neptune, and the correct prophecy had been observed after he had predicted it."}
{"translation": "It was Neptune's discovery that established the soundness of Newton's mechanical theory as the first natural scientific theory."}
{"translation": "So from that point of view, Newton's mechanics theory was beautiful, undeficient and unusual."}
{"translation": "But someone doesn't think so. That's Einstein."}
{"translation": "Einstein believes that Newton's gravitational theory is flawed and reflected in two ways."}
{"translation": "One is that theory is flawed."}
{"translation": "Einstein argues that the instantaneous effect in Newton's theory is contrary to the narrow theory of relativity."}
{"translation": "So he asked what gravity really is?"}
{"translation": "Deficiencies in usefulness."}
{"translation": "Einstein has taken a deep look at the anomaly of recent developments in Mercury."}
{"translation": "He believes that this cannot be explained by Newton's gravitational theory."}
{"translation": "So he asked what the scope of application of the Newton Gravitation theory was."}
{"translation": "It's two very big flaws for Einstein."}
{"translation": "Einstein therefore proposed a broad relativity which, of course, filled the gap in the Newton theory."}
{"translation": "His theoretical absence was reflected in the essence of gravity, which was the bending of time and space caused by quality."}
{"translation": "The bending of time and space determines the movement of all matter, including the movement of light."}
{"translation": "The absence of practicality is reflected in its approximation of the Newtonian theory under the weak gravitational field, which is more precise than the Newtonian theory in the case of the strong gravitational field."}
{"translation": "All the phenomena that the Newtonian theory can interpret are thus explained in general relativity."}
{"translation": "Broad relativity is also fully applicable where the Newtonian doctrine cannot be interpreted or where error cannot be ignored."}
{"translation": "The general theory of relativity was therefore not flawed at that time."}
{"translation": "So the theory also needs to be less common in order to satisfy the broad rule of aesthetics that are not common without defects."}
{"translation": "Another example of no flaw is that I've just told you about its theory, which is the essence of gravity. Practically, it's about making up for Newton's inaccuracies."}
{"translation": "The most important thing is that Mercury's aberrations in recent days."}
{"translation": "That's something Newton's theory doesn't understand at all."}
{"translation": "In general relativity, I gave you a list of places where we can see that this result is accurately calculated in broad relativity."}
{"translation": "A major flaw in Newton's theory has thus been addressed."}
{"translation": "Broad relativism is also commonplace and reflects the first theory to establish a profound link between material and space."}
{"translation": "I have just spoken of the Newton theory, which was the first quantitative and systematic scientific theory at the time, whereas the general relativity theory was the first to establish a profound link between material and space, and the first to reveal that the time and space of the material world are inherently bending."}
{"translation": "It used to be straight, and now it's crooked."}
{"translation": "And this theory has succeeded in predicting new types of celestial bodies and a series of new phenomena, including black holes, the expansion of the universe, gravitational distortions, gravitational red shifts, gravitational waves, and so on."}
{"translation": "Most of this is confirmed by observation."}
{"translation": "There are only a few left that are still waiting to be confirmed."}
{"translation": "Let me give you a brief example."}
{"translation": "This is the prophecy of gravitational contrasts to the test of general relativity."}
{"translation": "Because general relativity predicts that the light of distant objects must be skewed by the light of the Sun's gravitational field when passing near the Sun."}
{"translation": "So this one was observed by the experiment."}
{"translation": "It was this observation that established once and for all the superiority of the theory of general relativity over the Newton theory, which at that time led to widespread acceptance of the theory of general relativity."}
{"translation": "Are there any shortcomings in the theory of general relativity today?"}
{"translation": "If I say it's the most beautiful scientific theory, we certainly need to discuss whether it's flawed or not."}
{"translation": "In practical terms, you can say it's hard to understand the theory."}
{"translation": "Of course it's not Einstein's fault, is it?"}
{"translation": "It's hard to understand that you didn't learn."}
{"translation": "Is there a flaw in theory?"}
{"translation": "We know that there are problems and inconsistencies in quantum theory."}
{"translation": "Well, we'll certainly expect Professor Pan to solve this problem in the future. Okay."}
{"translation": "But at this point we do not know whether quantum theory is wrong or relativity in general."}
{"translation": "The question of the singularity was that Einstein did not believe the black hole that his own theory predicted, but he thought that nature might be able to avoid the singularity."}
{"translation": "Of course, quantum physicists think that quantum theory may be able to bypass the question of the singular."}
{"translation": "But none of these efforts have been successful today."}
{"translation": "I've done my own research on the question of singularities."}
{"translation": "The results of my research, if he lets me go forward, I will tell you that my research shows that there are actually no peculiarities within the black hole."}
{"translation": "But there is no need for new natural patterns."}
{"translation": "There is only a need to understand and apply the general relativity."}
{"translation": "It was a few years ago that I crossed back to report this to Mr. Einstein."}
{"translation": "There are no flaws!"}
{"translation": "So Einstein's theory, as we see it today, is still the least common without flaws."}
{"translation": "We are also looking forward to more unusual general relativism predictions."}
{"translation": "Like gravitational waves."}
{"translation": "Well, now the scientific community is rumouring, and maybe it's true, that the gravitational waves have been detected."}
{"translation": "If that is the case, it must be a Nobel Prize."}
{"translation": "Of course, we expect that the unusualness of this broader relative prophecy will bring us many, uh, surprises."}
{"translation": "Finally, what are the dynamics of social development and the essence of science, technology and innovation?"}
{"translation": "Let's use this aesthetic theory to explain it."}
{"translation": "There's no universal beauty, there's no universal beauty."}
{"translation": "As I said earlier, beauty is the only way to live."}
{"translation": "Not the most beautiful is the more beautiful."}
{"translation": "The quest for beauty is therefore the driving force of social development."}
{"translation": "We all know that technological innovation is about filling the gaps, while scientific innovation is about finding out that it is not common."}
{"translation": "So my conclusion is that the dynamics of social development and the essence of song technology and innovation are the pursuit of beauty."}
{"translation": "That's my report."}
{"translation": "Thank you!"}
