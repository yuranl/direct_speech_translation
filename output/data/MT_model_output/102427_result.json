{"translation": "Good afternoon, everyone."}
{"translation": "I am Zhang Wu Hung from the Shanghai Microsystem of the Chinese Academy of Sciences."}
{"translation": "So I am reporting today on how we can contribute to the security of this project through this information technology, which is represented by the Internet of things."}
{"translation": "I want to look at it in a few ways."}
{"translation": "We all hate this tofu project, but tofu work is inevitable at this stage."}
{"translation": "We can recall that in 2007 the Qijiang Bridge collapsed in an instant as a result of the impact of the ship."}
{"translation": "This was also a very important event at the time."}
{"translation": "So the highway also has a lot of this tofu project."}
{"translation": "We can look at one of the ratings on the Internet, that's the natural highway, that's Gansu."}
{"translation": "Soon after the passage of vehicles in 2011, although its construction works at a cost of up to one billion kilometres."}
{"translation": "But within a few days of construction, the highway breaks open and is immediately out of use for a maintenance period."}
{"translation": "We can also see an incident in Shanghai."}
{"translation": "We had a similar incident on the side of the Lotus River."}
{"translation": "At that time, the building collapsed as a result of the crushing of one of the earth."}
{"translation": "And, of course, this building behind it is not very low for this, uh, second-hand room that it's made of."}
{"translation": "Because they found this glass in this building, it's still very good."}
{"translation": "It's just that it didn't have a good foundation, but that doesn't deny that it did have some kind of slippage at the time."}
{"translation": "As a matter of fact, it's a network of things."}
{"translation": "It can be built from the source of the building to its operation and up to its maintenance as a whole to provide some security for the building."}
{"translation": "So we can start by looking at what's called a network of things."}
{"translation": "The term \" network of things \", which we gave Prime Minister Wen to Prime Minister Wen at the time of his visit to our laboratory's, uh, tinless subcentre, was in 2009."}
{"translation": "Prime Minister Wen then picked a network of things."}
{"translation": "Now we all know the word \"netting \"."}
{"translation": "So, while the word \"netting\" may be a little stranger to people's lives, we can see that there's actually a lot of things that are already online in life."}
{"translation": "We can look at some bikes like Moby, OFOs, and that's some of the good applications of the Internet."}
{"translation": "It's the smart driving or the car that's in there now."}
{"translation": "This network of hundreds of these different sensors is inside each vehicle to monitor the quality of the vehicle and its operational status."}
{"translation": "So here's what Shanghai's doing right now."}
{"translation": "Put the poles in a system like that."}
{"translation": "We can make it a recharge stake down there, then we can make a WIFI, and then we can do some of this environmental monitoring on its basis."}
{"translation": "It's also a good application for the uh-material network."}
{"translation": "So we can look back at some of the earlier applications of the Internet, and I'll start from the right."}
{"translation": "This is the blue algal monitoring that we did in Lake Tai in 2009, when the water quality of the Lake Tai basin was also very poor."}
{"translation": "And what about the security system in Shibo, which was also a big, monolithic network system at the time."}
{"translation": "We can look to the left."}
{"translation": "And this is the network system we made for this thing at Pudong Airport."}
{"translation": "From 2006 to more than a decade now, he has been working normally."}
{"translation": "And we've got a dozen people inside who want to destroy, but he hasn't."}
{"translation": "The main reason is that we have such a networked system to carry out some early monitoring of it and to be able to pre-empt and capture these spoilers."}
{"translation": "So going back to today's theme is how we're going to help build this safe on the E.U.T. Network?"}
{"translation": "It's a safe place for us to look first at the construction of the building."}
{"translation": "What can the Internet do?"}
{"translation": "We have a few important things in the construction."}
{"translation": "First, how can a builder ensure that the right person is a qualified person doing something that he can reasonably do?"}
{"translation": "On the other hand, we would like to ensure that this material, including its processes, including its safeguards, is met."}
{"translation": "Let's take a look at the first of these. There's some of these things in the building site, and we can monitor in real time whether the manager is on duty."}
{"translation": "He has, electrician."}
{"translation": "Is he really an electrician operating some electrical devices?"}
{"translation": "Is there a corresponding certificate for the man who hangs this tower?"}
{"translation": "There are some systems that can take root, some techniques that can be used to locate."}
{"translation": "So electricity is not qualified for building materials."}
{"translation": "We can also enter from every material in the early stages, and I will monitor it and place it in the designated position when it is tested."}
{"translation": "When people move these building materials again, the system is able to remain a retroactive step from the time it enters and exits to the time it is acquired."}
{"translation": "It's like we're making food retrospectives."}
{"translation": "And the third thing is that we need to make sure that the process is not perfect."}
{"translation": "We'll have, uh, some of the means of networking, sensors, including some of our video surveillance, to detect whether or not we're meeting the standards."}
{"translation": "Also, we can see if the safeguards are in place and our scaffolds are stable and reliable."}
{"translation": "So we'll do some sensors up there to monitor this mass."}
{"translation": "So on this basis, uh, we did a whole set of things-based solutions or systems."}
{"translation": "We can see a variety of these sensors at the bottom."}
{"translation": "We can manage the personnel, the tower and the hook, including the elevator."}
{"translation": "We also manage the environment, including drainage, including videos, and the movement and exit of vehicles, including their weight, and some automatic detection."}
{"translation": "With these sensors, we control all the condition of this entire construction site by means of information."}
{"translation": "After taking control, we built up a variety of systems for this type of application to monitor and analyse it safely."}
{"translation": "So let me give you a few examples."}
{"translation": "First on the left, when we have these security incidents, I want to make sure where my people are, where my equipment is and where my rescue measures are."}
{"translation": "In this case, there is also a system for monitoring."}
{"translation": "The tower's safe is also, uh, a very important system."}
{"translation": "We'll have sensors on this tower to detect whether it's tilted, whether it's swinging and so on."}
{"translation": "What about environmental construction and monitoring, which is now a very demanding piece of government."}
{"translation": "We can make sure that the water in the atmosphere is not contaminated, so this is a very important piece of the network that solves this construction safety."}
{"translation": "And this is a big question that we're thinking about."}
{"translation": "Our country has been building this glass curtain wall since the 1980s."}
{"translation": "The high buildings in our city are also very dense."}
{"translation": "Our entire glass curtain wall is 85 per cent global, a very high amount."}
{"translation": "But there's a problem with the glass curtain wall."}
{"translation": "Although the glass curtain wall has many advantages, it's more beautiful, and then it's relatively simple to build."}
{"translation": "So the glass actually lasts only 15 years."}
{"translation": "In normal use, the glass's structural glue, it's only been on it for about 10 years."}
{"translation": "So whether the glass is broken or the structural glue is not working, it's going to have a lot to do with it."}
{"translation": "What about the glass wall monitoring this area?"}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, since China was the country that used the largest glass curtain wall in the world, its research in that area was not as advanced as it was abroad."}
{"translation": "So now the conventional tests are probably the most we can do with a piece of glass behind our backs."}
{"translation": "So there's also some kind of test to hit with this rubber hammer, and look at the sound of this glass, so the comparison is primitive and backward."}
{"translation": "At the same time, we have some building materials whose lifetime is mostly glass."}
{"translation": "It includes structural glue, including some of the structural parts in it, and has a relatively short life, unlike our concrete structure."}
{"translation": "And the third is the fact that the external factor also has a greater impact."}
{"translation": "Typhoons have a significant impact on bridges, but typhoons also have a similar effect on glass."}
{"translation": "It goes on and on and on and on, right?"}
{"translation": "At the same time, our glass is washed every year."}
{"translation": "Then when the outside walls are rubbing, this tower hangs down."}
{"translation": "And then when the wind blows, it swings, and it hits the glass, so it brings a lot of safety."}
{"translation": "Well, we actually had a similar incident in Shanghai in the early years."}
{"translation": "The whole glass fell down."}
{"translation": "Good thing it hit the car, didn't hit anybody."}
{"translation": "Think of an egg that falls off dozens of floors that can smash a dead man, not to mention a glass."}
{"translation": "So we're using the technology and means of networking to work out a system for the security monitoring of this glass wall. It's some kind of collaboration with some schools."}
{"translation": "So we have this sensor at the front end, which is capable of detecting this vibration, stress, reaction, temperature, etc., some of the parameters that affect the safety of the glass."}
{"translation": "So there are also some transmission techniques in this narrowband network that can very easily capture some state data from the front end glass."}
{"translation": "So when we collect it, we can use some big data, some hand tools for cloud computing in this platform."}
{"translation": "It also combines artificial intelligence, which is now more fashionable."}
{"translation": "We have done a great deal of this data collection and analysis."}
{"translation": "Then you can warn early about a model that will break the curtain wall that built this glass."}
{"translation": "In that case, we can see the extent of the risk."}
{"translation": "The second question is, do we have access to the glass wall or not?"}
{"translation": "In fact, in accordance with our safety standards, glass is relatively safe, but with our system, we believe that the future will be safer."}
{"translation": "So the third question is, how we solve things on the Internet is some kind of safety in the process."}
{"translation": "This map on the left is our gold-trading building."}
{"translation": "When we think about the security of this building, we probably think about the high-rise building first."}
{"translation": "In fact, some of the places that are now very dangerous are these micro-sites, including this type of rental housing."}
{"translation": "There are also more people living in some of the family's workshops, including water, electricity and fire hazards."}
{"translation": "Like we're in this theater right now, if there's a fire next to it, it's probably gone, but we don't know if there's a fire next door."}
{"translation": "By the time it burns, we might be very late."}
{"translation": "Are there any means and measures to solve this problem or to provide us with some clues?"}
{"translation": "Yes."}
{"translation": "So we're, uh, working on a lot of methods, and we're doing a lot of networked systems for a lot of different applications."}
{"translation": "So this is also the kind of smoke that's hot now called the stand-alone smoke."}
{"translation": "The traditional smoke is probably linked to the fire department, including the spray facility."}
{"translation": "In any given building, it must have this equipment if it is to be certified."}
{"translation": "But now there's some independent smoke, so what we can integrate into it is some of the more hot technologies called NB-IOT, including Lora and so on."}
{"translation": "Because of these narrowband transmission techniques, for example, it can last for more than 10 years, we can put this on the head of the room and incorporate some of this voice broadcast information on it."}
{"translation": "So if there's a fire next door, we all know it in this room."}
{"translation": "So this is with the support of the Shanghai Economic Commission and the CST."}
{"translation": "We've got this Orient bead from this Yang Po and the Rainbow Pass, and now we've got, uh, nearly 30,000 of this independent smoke."}
{"translation": "So you can buy this equipment and put it in your house if you're interested in it."}
{"translation": "You can see through APP that there's not this kind of fire or danger in your house."}
{"translation": "So the safety of the elevator is a big problem now."}
{"translation": "Shanghai is actually a place where, uh, an elevator is very widely used."}
{"translation": "We have nearly 300,000 elevators in stock, and there may be thousands of elevators over 15 years of service."}
{"translation": "So there are 780,000 in 10 to 15 years, so that's a big amount."}
{"translation": "The actual useful life of the elevator is generally only 10 years, as required, so it is a big question how to maintain it."}
{"translation": "Although we didn't have that many accidents, there's certainly a lot of work to be done for the safety of this elevator."}
{"translation": "So now we're talking about adding a lot of sensors to the elevator, including the floor, including the floor, including the smoke, including the current of this, uh, major wire that I can calibrate the elevator, and so on, including its temperature, to determine whether the elevator is safe."}
{"translation": "So, when we do this, we get a lot of status data from the elevators, so we can do a lot of intelligence analysis remotely."}
{"translation": "I can actually do one thing when I'm done with the analysis, and it's this rationalization of the elevator."}
{"translation": "The normal security of the elevators now may be carried out by people on paper."}
{"translation": "Did he go?"}
{"translation": "How's Viva?"}
{"translation": "No one knows."}
{"translation": "But with the future of a networked system, we can effectively guarantee the safety of each elevator."}
{"translation": "So this isn't really my specialty."}
{"translation": "It is in this building that we will have some new winds, including some water supplies, some drainage systems."}
{"translation": "So some of them have some technical means of networking."}
{"translation": "We can look at the wind, for example, at the vent of the new wind, and look at the quality of the air in this inner room, what its temperature is, what its humidity is, and then adjust the most appropriate temperature and humidity."}
{"translation": "So in the drain, we can look at the amount of water, the speed at which it's going, and then there's some contamination in it, and so on."}
{"translation": "That would make the building safe."}
{"translation": "That's what our partner did on that little Guangzhou loin."}
{"translation": "High buildings like this, we've got some uh sensors on it, and we can look at some of the swings of this tower, see some of its vibrations, and we can tell if it's in a safe state."}
{"translation": "So this is what I think this kind of thing will be used later on high buildings like ours, including the Shanghai Center."}
{"translation": "And the other one, this one was a job for me in '78."}
{"translation": "That's when we made this security system for the South Water North Central."}
{"translation": "The median line then draws 1432 km of water from the Dan mouth reservoir, which is the southern border of the Lake North River, to Beijing and Tianjin, where 1 billion cubic metres of water per year."}
{"translation": "But there are a lot of problems in this."}
{"translation": "And we can look at it, and we can look at it, and we can look at it, and we can see it, and we can see it, and we can see it, and we can see it, and we can see it, and we can see it, and we can see it, and we can see it, and we can see it, and we can see it, and we can see it, and we can see it, and we can see it, and we can see it, and we can see it, and we can see it, and we can see it, and we can see it, and we can see it."}
{"translation": "So it's very complex."}
{"translation": "There are, then, a lot of security problems."}
{"translation": "A sink like that, two clicks long, it's full of water."}
{"translation": "The pressure of thousands of tons of water on the entire base is also very high."}
{"translation": "So we've got a variety of sensors up there to monitor its deposition, seepage pressure, so we've built up some systems for this, uh, engineering security monitoring accordingly."}
{"translation": "At the same time, we combine some of the weather information on the periphery with, uh, some of the weather department and some of the rainfall stations on the ground."}
{"translation": "And at the same time, we did some monitoring of water quantity and quality and so on."}
{"translation": "Bring this information together to protect the safety of this entire operation in the north of the south."}
{"translation": "And at the same time, we built this system to prevent human intrusion."}
{"translation": "That means if someone climbs my fence into my channel, I'll know that I can still easily get him to, uh, find him in advance and point him out."}
{"translation": "That would also enhance the safety of the project."}
{"translation": "Let me give you an example."}
{"translation": "This kind of invasion is also a great danger."}
{"translation": "Because this is an artificially dug project, it's hard to get out of this channel once we're in it."}
{"translation": "Because this is the edge of cement, it's very difficult to climb up."}
{"translation": "So human security is also a very central issue in the whole South Water North."}
{"translation": "So let's talk about some of the technical means of connecting the various things before us to solve this or to ensure the security of this building."}
{"translation": "Whether it's the bridge, whether it's the building, the highway, or the North of the South."}
{"translation": "The new sensor of the future is indeed a very core piece of it, and perhaps the future is something that can be done."}
{"translation": "But what we're talking about here is the intelligent architecture of the future, which necessarily informs the construction of the building, including its running, updating and maintenance to the future."}
{"translation": "So, on the one hand, raising the security level of the building and, on the other hand, making it easier for people to live."}
{"translation": "But I can see that our country actually has a lot of flaws in this, uh, new sensor."}
{"translation": "On the one hand, we are very much in need of new types of sensors, but we can also see them in particular with regard to these high-end intelligent sensors."}
{"translation": "The United States, Japan and Germany are relatively advanced, accounting for about 70 per cent of the world, and our countries are about 10 per cent."}
{"translation": "At the same time, from the point of view of production, there are only about 20,000 sensors in our country."}
{"translation": "So this is, uh, one of our big shorts, so what's the good thing about the other one?"}
{"translation": "It's our national, uh, sensor industry."}
{"translation": "The original imitation has now begun gradually to expand to higher ends."}
{"translation": "Uh, some chip factories in our country are starting to take some high-end routes."}
{"translation": "Let me give you a few simple examples."}
{"translation": "Some of our high-speed accelerators, including gyroscopes, were used relatively well in this military industry and are now being converted to civilian use."}
{"translation": "And then some of our pressure sensors are now also being applied in this water table, in the gas table."}
{"translation": "Including some of the blast-proof sensors we made, we were already using this security check, including at Pudong Airport."}
{"translation": "We have some equipment for this millimetre wave, including some for security checks, which is already in use at the airport."}
{"translation": "So I believe that in the next three to five years, we have many high-end sensors that can make a breakthrough."}
{"translation": "So with these sensors, we can provide the building, especially the future building, with more powerful technologies and tools for its safety, and for its safety to be protected."}
{"translation": "Thank you!"}
