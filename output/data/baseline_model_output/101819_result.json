{"translation": "Good evening, everybody"}
{"translation": "Today we are going to talk about why anti-gene technology should not be"}
{"translation": "Topic is a very hot topic"}
{"translation": "If you pay"}
{"translation": "Please cooperate with me and let us make a small choice"}
{"translation": "We now have two different"}
{"translation": "15 One is genetically modified food and the other is biotechnology food or food"}
{"translation": "Okay, friends who are willing to choose genetically modified foods to cancel their hands"}
{"translation": "Okay, I don\u2019t seem to see a few walking"}
{"translation": "Friends who are curious about our willingness to choose biotech food, raise their hands"}
{"translation": "Ok i saw everything hand ok"}
{"translation": "In fact, genetically modified food and biotech food are the same"}
{"translation": "Are all made with the same technology"}
{"translation": "So from this friend"}
{"translation": "We must not blindly oppose genetic modification"}
{"translation": "Once upon a time, some people thought that genetically modified food was a conspiracy made by the Americans. After eating genetically modified food, then he would gradually lose the ability to reproduce, and then the Chinese human architecture would be wiped out."}
{"translation": "This is a conspiracy theory"}
{"translation": "After the conversion, think about it, it\u2019s not like that"}
{"translation": "Actually in the United States in a country like the United States, right? Their people are genetically modified"}
{"translation": ""}
{"translation": "There are more than 2,000 different genetically modified foods on the market and there is no mandatory label in the United States."}
{"translation": "So the people don\u2019t know what they\u2019re saying"}
{"translation": "So i thought"}
{"translation": "Americans should be the first group of people to use genetic modification because the United States was the first to produce it."}
{"translation": "So if that&#39;s the case, will Americans be infertile?"}
{"translation": "Obviously not like that"}
{"translation": "Because someone once said that in order to oppose this American using genetically modified foods to destroy Chinese dragon breeds. Because I am a descendant of the dragon, I have to protect the general election certificate for each movement."}
{"translation": "Just the opposite"}
{"translation": "Then again, in January of this year, the U.S. approved the genetically modified insect-resistant rice that China has not seen in China."}
{"translation": "Because what do you do"}
{"translation": "China&#39;s genetically modified insect-resistant rice can be practically sold in the United States from now on"}
{"translation": "The so-called conspiracy theory is self-defeating by this"}
{"translation": "Because the Americans themselves also introduced genetically modified rice from China for use"}
{"translation": "So what I said is ridiculous and ridiculous now when I think about it"}
{"translation": "Why"}
{"translation": "Use another example to illustrate"}
{"translation": "I don\u2019t think any of our viewers don\u2019t like high-speed rail, right?"}
{"translation": "High-speed rail is the pride of China"}
{"translation": "No one goes far and doesn\u2019t want to take the high-speed rail."}
{"translation": "But do you know that it was the same when the train first entered China more than 100 years ago"}
{"translation": "See there is a picture here, right"}
{"translation": "A group of people said that the train destroyed China\u2019s dragon veins"}
{"translation": "If yes, it set off a strong movement of the Baolong line of the Pakistan Railway, right?"}
{"translation": "Let&#39;s think about how ridiculous it is to sell Railway Baolu"}
{"translation": "Maybe another 20 years"}
{"translation": "It\u2019s also ridiculous that we reverse Qibaolong"}
{"translation": "So i thought"}
{"translation": "We shouldn&#39;t do such a ridiculous thing"}
{"translation": "Maybe we think about what a turnaround is"}
{"translation": "First of all, I want to introduce a concept what is *"}
{"translation": "Today it is a piece of ribonucleic acid with genetic function. This fragment is the simplest explanation."}
{"translation": "What is a turnaround?"}
{"translation": "What is a turnaround?"}
{"translation": "Actually genetically modified"}
{"translation": "We can understand it as a technology or as a process"}
{"translation": "Therefore, let&#39;s make it simpler"}
{"translation": "In other words, the technique of transferring genes from one species to another is called a legend."}
{"translation": "Or to say"}
{"translation": "Genes in one species are transferred to another species through a certain medium"}
{"translation": "This is also the process of genetic modification. So one is the process and the other is the technology."}
{"translation": ""}
{"translation": "Opposition to success or against technology"}
{"translation": "Then of course, he needs a certain medium to transfer into it. We said that it can only be made through natural hybridization."}
{"translation": "Seeing that this naturally occurring hybrid produced a lot of new things"}
{"translation": "Humans have learned to perform artificial hybridization"}
{"translation": "We can also turn for the better if we use modern biotechnology"}
{"translation": "The process of turning around is getting this climax"}
{"translation": "We look at it from a technical point of view"}
{"translation": "In fact, we can also consider the process"}
{"translation": "A turnaround process can actually occur between different individuals of the same species"}
{"translation": "Occurs between individuals of different species"}
{"translation": "Transition is a process of gene transfer. Of course, it needs a kind of gene transfer."}
{"translation": "Several photography enthusiasts like to take pictures"}
{"translation": "I often go to nature, I see which different insects are there, right? They come to carry out this medium as a medium to transfer genes between different substances or different flowers"}
{"translation": "The most recent is the situation of natural turning eyes"}
{"translation": "Now everyone can see the picture below. This is also one of the legendary things that God is doing."}
{"translation": ""}
{"translation": "We have a purple corn on the cob. This kind of corn is also planted with a white corn on the cob."}
{"translation": "Think about it, if the pollen of this purple corn floats on top of this white corn with the wind"}
{"translation": "What color corn cobs will they produce"}
{"translation": "Think about it"}
{"translation": "Black and white, everyone said it well"}
{"translation": "Then everyone take a look"}
{"translation": "Produced such corn on the cob"}
{"translation": "Obviously he is different from before and its changes are more abundant, right?"}
{"translation": "So the genetic modification process is a creation of movies"}
{"translation": "Let our kind of home have more choice price opportunities"}
{"translation": "This is the natural turning point we are talking about"}
{"translation": "In order to obtain more such genetic variation, Yongjia"}
{"translation": "It is convenient for us to select the best ones for breeding to form good varieties"}
{"translation": "You said to improve his bottle, feel his impact resistance, improve his disease resistance, etc."}
{"translation": "In the process of mutation, we can also use color lines to compile"}
{"translation": "Say you see that we saw you paint space breeding like this"}
{"translation": "Send the rocket carried by our seeds to space to let the rays come from and then it will produce pictures, which can produce mutations"}
{"translation": "And we can also fuse different cells together and let them produce the so-called cell hybridization, which can also produce changes."}
{"translation": "But if these mutations are like this kind of process, they are all random. It takes a long time to complete a job."}
{"translation": "So the turnaround we are talking about today or the short-term most discussed by the public is actually the use of biotechnology to transfer opportunities in Beijing."}
{"translation": "Technology"}
{"translation": "We can cultivate cotton that has been transformed into papaya seeds and refined."}
{"translation": "So in fact, let\u2019s take a look at this transition process."}
{"translation": "Just now we talked about God, he is a crossbreed, so now we say God is too blind"}
{"translation": "Human-dog hybrids are also busy"}
{"translation": "So if we want him to be very specific and precise, how do we do what we want?"}
{"translation": "Then we first find a car like this we call intelligence, right?"}
{"translation": "Then for this intelligence, you can cut it through a small cut and lead him to this position with the fragment we need."}
{"translation": "Thinking of one of our taxis, let me get in a taxi and put it in a bureau"}
{"translation": "Then he can transcribe a lot of copies that can be reproduced"}
{"translation": "Then he can go to contact the genetically modified cell that we need to transfer"}
{"translation": "Then in the process, he can see the intellectual gene, which he can release from the cell, and if it is new, he can transfer to the cell and avoid fusion with the chromosomal gene in the chromosome of our cell."}
{"translation": "Cultivated into a different white jade merchant organization"}
{"translation": "Then the budget is organized and after training, he grows into a small seedling. This small seedling grows into a big temple after being cultivated in Jin."}
{"translation": "So in this kind of seedling, he contains the transit brigade, so let&#39;s make the transit prohibition."}
{"translation": "If you look at this inventory, it is consistent with our traditional goal"}
{"translation": "But it is faster, more precise and more efficient"}
{"translation": "Let&#39;s take a look"}
{"translation": "Why we shouldn&#39;t take a turn for the better"}
{"translation": "Then everyone knows that ensuring that people all over the world have food to eat is a very, very serious task. This kind of task allows everyone to eat and eat."}
{"translation": "So everyone look at this curve"}
{"translation": "This curve of the city represents a trend of population growth"}
{"translation": "And the blue dotted line at the back shows two possibilities for two productions"}
{"translation": "If we use the happy technology, right? We can make good use of the land, then the food may come from the upper route."}
{"translation": "Can just meet the needs of people&#39;s growth"}
{"translation": "But if we don\u2019t use this"}
{"translation": "It\u2019s impossible that our food will blow a huge gap. Once a gap appears, then there will actually be a problem."}
{"translation": "Think about it everyone"}
{"translation": "As long as the rice with Chinese characters is composed of two parts"}
{"translation": "What is a part called"}
{"translation": "Teacher right"}
{"translation": "What is it"}
{"translation": ""}
{"translation": "If food security cannot be guaranteed"}
{"translation": "It will cause turmoil in this society"}
{"translation": "Then population growth is a very, very big problem, which puts huge pressure on our food guarantee"}
{"translation": "Then there is something to say about the process of urbanization"}
{"translation": "This process of infrastructure construction also occupies a lot of land"}
{"translation": "Let\u2019s take a look. Here is a photo. It was taken in a certain place in Shanghai 30 years ago."}
{"translation": "Can everyone recognize where this is?"}
{"translation": "But 20 years later, we took the same group of photos in the same place."}
{"translation": "Do you know"}
{"translation": "This is a photo 20 years later"}
{"translation": "Do we know"}
{"translation": "It seems that everyone knows it, right? It\u2019s normal, right? It\u2019s in Pudong."}
{"translation": "Who said that? We can see that many places in the previous two days have become roads and cities."}
{"translation": "As each urbanization process takes up a lot of land"}
{"translation": "Our country hopes to save 1,800,000,000 such a land"}
{"translation": "But so far it\u2019s very, very difficult"}
{"translation": "Actually we still face many problems"}
{"translation": "For example, our resources are constantly valuing, our global climate is volatile"}
{"translation": "You see, we are like our Shanghai on the beach, we have a lot of water around us, but maybe everyone knows that Shanghai is an area lacking drinking water, right?"}
{"translation": "With these voluntary rules, there are a lot of problems"}
{"translation": "The other thing is that we want to increase the production of food to ensure that everyone has food to eat"}
{"translation": "then what should we do"}
{"translation": "If we increase production, can we expand the area of arable land?"}
{"translation": "It must be impossible to download in China."}
{"translation": "So do we do this? We give him more glory and turn it all into fertilizer"}
{"translation": "Would you like to do this"}
{"translation": "Then go to your bowl"}
{"translation": "Right"}
{"translation": "This road can&#39;t be found in China"}
{"translation": "The already thick farmland ecological environment has been greatly damaged"}
{"translation": "Then the only thing we can do is to use very rich genetic resources and combine our new biotechnology including our genetically modified technology."}
{"translation": "Only then can we transfer to Pakistan at a high-speed, accurate, and efficient price to produce more of this grain"}
{"translation": "I just mentioned that China sprays 2 million tons of pesticides into our farmland every year."}
{"translation": "Think about 2 million degrees of pesticides, right?"}
{"translation": "Now we can use alternative technology we can use genetically modified insect-resistant rice"}
{"translation": "You can see that the long distance is the short-term resistance to the green and secluded waterways, right?"}
{"translation": "And the normal rice"}
{"translation": "In the case of pesticides, you can see that the difference between them is very, very big"}
{"translation": "So what we can say is that we traditionally hope to transfer a useful case that white ball to a better variety to avoid the goal achieved by traditional methods."}
{"translation": "The market is less accurate"}
{"translation": "We use the current method as the purpose of a great retrogression in history"}
{"translation": "You can see that we can be more efficient and accurate, and there is also such a method that will be related to this reproductive disorder to achieve the purpose of genetic modification, right?"}
{"translation": "You said that we want to transfer the gene from the one who raised such a drought-resistant and the one who raised him to the waterway. Obviously, the method we have noticed cannot be crossed."}
{"translation": "But if we have biotechnology and then switch to technology, we can easily achieve this goal, right?"}
{"translation": "So this turnaround is indeed a very good price tag"}
{"translation": "But maybe our friends will ask you to say that this transfer is so good. Does it have any other problems?"}
{"translation": "It\u2019s true that he may still have some problems when making a turn for a new technology."}
{"translation": "Then I don\u2019t want to solve these"}
{"translation": "Everyone who exists first thinks that we think that food is our heaven."}
{"translation": "Whether he has food or not depends on the food safety issue, right? Will he have any problems after eating?"}
{"translation": "Then what impact will it have on the environment?"}
{"translation": "Otherwise"}
{"translation": "Then there are some other things like whether we should label our transit videos so that the people have the right to know and choose."}
{"translation": "Is the country\u2019s laws and regulations to do these things, etc. There are many choices"}
{"translation": ""}
{"translation": "In our country, there are very complete regulations to control this matter"}
{"translation": "And in other words, when we transfer any genetically modified gene into the production process, he must strictly carry out this safety evaluation. Only after it is safe, he can sell it before it can be commercialized."}
{"translation": "Therefore,"}
{"translation": "International agencies believe that it is safe to transfer genetically modified food into products"}
{"translation": "The two international organizations of the United Nations also believe that software products are safe and the other is legal."}
{"translation": "All text messages from all over the world are carried out under this framework."}
{"translation": "Now let\u2019s take a look at the legend about why genetic modification can\u2019t be reversed."}
{"translation": "Now, as Chinese, why shouldn\u2019t we come to reverse the gene even more? Let\u2019s take a look together"}
{"translation": "This edible genetically modified food has been caught in the world for nearly 20 years"}
{"translation": "In this process"}
{"translation": "In the short term, the area of such a neutron is expanding very rapidly, right? Now it has reached more than 1.8 hectares. Let me calculate that it is about 2.7 or 2.8 billion acres of each area."}
{"translation": "The green line above the green line indicates the overall planting area of the city transit"}
{"translation": "If the line is red and blue, it shows that the area is in developed countries"}
{"translation": "At the same time this line is developing countries"}
{"translation": "Developing countries have already surpassed this planting area in developed countries"}
{"translation": "But under such an increasing price situation that the whole world looks like, our situation in China is"}
{"translation": "You see, from 2002, we ranked 4th, right? Later, we ranked 5th and 6th. Now we are ranked to the bottom, right?"}
{"translation": "This is very dissatisfied with our country\u2019s status"}
{"translation": "There is a set of data, everyone can come and have a look"}
{"translation": "In 2001, China ranked 4th. We have the United States, Canada and Argentina ahead of us."}
{"translation": "But since 2003, Brazil surpassed us. Then in 2007, India surpassed us, so we ranked 6th."}
{"translation": "What a pity"}
{"translation": "India used to be an importer of cotton"}
{"translation": "He has become an exporter of cotton when he uses this technology, right?"}
{"translation": "Well, China is already much smaller than him in this number."}
{"translation": "And why are there many small countries catching up with China in the 6th place after many years?"}
{"translation": "So by the year 2600, China immediately ranked 8th. Last year, the Bar of Paraguay Paraguay and Pakistan surpassed us."}
{"translation": "I&#39;m thinking about what kind of country it will be, closely following China for about 10 years"}
{"translation": "Paraguay is a very small country with only over 6 million people"}
{"translation": "A country with 1.4 billion people and a country with 6 million people"}
{"translation": "Such a difference between them, this image is very worthy, is it dissatisfied with the status of our country in all aspects"}
{"translation": "Once we say"}
{"translation": "If you don&#39;t advance, you will retreat"}
{"translation": "Because genetic modification is a technology that makes money, genetic modification is also a technological highland"}
{"translation": "If we do not occupy, other countries will definitely stand"}
{"translation": "When we are still arguing about whether to develop and change usage"}
{"translation": "Many countries have quietly surpassed us"}
{"translation": "I think this phenomenon is very, very serious"}
{"translation": "And food security is also a very important issue"}
{"translation": "Our country now imports 11 tons of grain every year"}
{"translation": "A ton of grain"}
{"translation": "What is this concept"}
{"translation": "I calculated that every person would import 70 kilograms of grain from you, China, and every person in China."}
{"translation": "What day"}
{"translation": "Then we will have a relatively big price problem"}
{"translation": "It&#39;s not that we don&#39;t develop"}
{"translation": "I will definitely lose such an opportunity"}
{"translation": "So when we think back to China\u2019s genetically modified production, we have had a glorious period."}
{"translation": "The success of genetically modified cotton is not only about saving China\u2019s cotton industry"}
{"translation": "And it makes the whole world feel very impressive"}
{"translation": "Think about the past when our Zhuanji papaya hadn&#39;t been on the market, farmers had no choice but to face the harm of the virus."}
{"translation": "But today we see them carrying the anti-virus in a few years, and the efficiency of China&#39;s harvest harvest"}
{"translation": "It\u2019s because we feel how creative this technology is and how it brings us happiness"}
{"translation": "Therefore, I want to hope that our technology can make our lives better"}
{"translation": "Thanks everyone"}
