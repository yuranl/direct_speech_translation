{"translation": "Political struggle in the workplace is a hot topic"}
{"translation": "We have often talked about those who are all correct readers of state-owned enterprises, but many friends asked me if your foreign companies can&#39;t do it. They also scolded Steve Jobs when he was started by the company&#39;s management. Even the founder of a company can When the management of this company went there, we can see that you, a foreign state-owned enterprise with political struggles, are worse than anything else."}
{"translation": "Then I think it will name your righteous struggle. He has the most basic premise that the company\u2019s management position, the board of directors, serves the company\u2019s board of directors, and that is the owner of the company."}
{"translation": "For other owners, the most important thing for a company is profitability. In fact, you don\u2019t recognize illegality."}
{"translation": "So under certain prerequisites, his struggle basically followed some of these rules"}
{"translation": "It\u2019s a bit different from the beginning. If other management is given, it is responsible to the government department represented by the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission."}
{"translation": "What this government department requires is not just profitability. It should care about whether your company promotes social harmony and stability, but not the employment rate of the society, especially the employment of the seven aunts and eight aunts of certain leaders Situation"}
{"translation": "He is more complicated"}
{"translation": "Therefore, the form of the positive struggle you give to foreign companies is completely different from that of the state, mainly because of the difference in ownership."}
{"translation": "We Chinese people don\u2019t like struggle. When we talk about struggle, we think of some dark, dirty, mean and long methods."}
{"translation": "For example, if you think that fighting in the dark, sitting on the mountain and watching the tiger fighting, you describe the struggle as the first episode and it&#39;s not visible."}
{"translation": "The Chinese philosophy of life is also not recommended for you to read it. Instead, it is recommended to adopt a wise and safe diet philosophy of forbearance and retreat."}
{"translation": "For example, you can bear to have children, such as taking a step back and elif"}
{"translation": "There are still many people who hang poems about a big yard in the study, as if they think they have a lot of cultural history."}
{"translation": "But such a philosophy of forbearance and retreat is very inconsistent with the spirit of modern corporate civilization."}
{"translation": "In modern commercial civilization, what we need is professional talents"}
{"translation": "What are professionals?"}
{"translation": "Maybe you will think that I have done my own things and I am a professional"}
{"translation": "I tell you this idea is very naive"}
{"translation": "For a professional, you have to be able to do your own thing"}
{"translation": "This is a basic premise"}
{"translation": "More importantly, you have to fight for yourself the threshold that allows you to do this."}
{"translation": "First of all, if you don\u2019t have the ability to fight for the right to do things, you will oust when you haven\u2019t had a chance to use your ability."}
{"translation": "So for a professional, you must not only have the ability to meet the responsibilities of your job, but also have the ability to fight for yourself the right to do this thing. In addition, you must also have the ability to fight for yourself to meet the efforts you have made. Of these memories"}
{"translation": "If you do not have the ability to do these things, then your leader will think you are a person with insufficient comprehensive ability"}
{"translation": "I am here to cite a lot of misunderstandings about the struggle in the workplace."}
{"translation": "The first misunderstanding is that we don\u2019t need to move when doing business"}
{"translation": "This kind of idea is very silly and naive. It is also a common idea of many diligent business people"}
{"translation": "Even if I do my own business well, I don\u2019t have to engage in those open and secret fights, and I\u2019m safe."}
{"translation": "I can simply take care of the ice cream in front of my door. I don\u2019t want to watch the fire"}
{"translation": "But many people will complain about it"}
{"translation": "Because he found that he is very professional but what"}
{"translation": "And he was accused of doing some assistant work"}
{"translation": "So he began to feel that his talents were not met, and he began to feel that his aura was not in line with this company."}
{"translation": "At that time, I thought it was very strange. You insisted on your outstanding business ability. Why don\u2019t you ask yourself to fight for a stage?"}
{"translation": "Why not fight for yourself a platform to use your abilities"}
{"translation": "Here I have to give an example of a woman I admire very much"}
{"translation": "This is the one we just saw, that is, he is an ad copywriter among American TV madmen"}
{"translation": "Well, this woman turned out to be a secretary because in the 1960s in the United States, there was still a common pricing in the United Kingdom. Many women came out to work and could only do such junior positions as secretaries."}
{"translation": "But the talented woman here put forward some very thoughtful advertising ideas when he was in the position of secretary, and then he got a client with independent advertising ideas."}
{"translation": "After doing this, has the company promoted her and raised her salary?"}
{"translation": "no"}
{"translation": "This is normal because every boss is selfish"}
{"translation": "If you can do an advertising copy job for me with a salary as a secretary"}
{"translation": "Isn&#39;t it bumped?"}
{"translation": "But this woman is not willing to be bullied like this"}
{"translation": "He found his leader and told him that I have two 19. First, you have to change my title to ad copy. Second, I want to have my own office like other ad copy."}
{"translation": "His request was met"}
{"translation": "We might as well imagine what would happen if he didn\u2019t make these two requests or was sitting on the secretary\u2019s child in front of the supervisor at the door. They said he was holding the water they said."}
{"translation": "He will certainly be unsatisfied, and he will certainly blame others"}
{"translation": "Will there be an ad creative exclusion on a regular basis?"}
{"translation": "Will his talents be buried because he is resentful and scolds his creative passion and being suppressed?"}
{"translation": "If he doesn\u2019t know how to fight for his own power, his talent suppresses the company and the loss of a talented ad copy is actually a result of losing both."}
{"translation": "From such a case, if you are good at fighting for your own interests, being good at fighting for your position is actually beneficial to the company&#39;s interests."}
{"translation": "Then I will talk about the second common misunderstanding of political struggles in the workplace, which is to give me a title and give me a punch. This idea is also very silly and naive."}
{"translation": "We often meet some business card believers outside who are the general manager, the president and even the director."}
{"translation": "I chatted with him and found that this person does not have human rights or financial rights. I know he can\u2019t be interviewed by a reporter because the headquarters does not allow him to express any opinions to the media."}
{"translation": "Can only distribute those places that the headquarters asked him to distribute, can&#39;t make any other explanations"}
{"translation": "Such a life has this title. In fact, what he does is the job of a very ordinary business manager."}
{"translation": "This kind of thing abounds"}
{"translation": "Then I can give me a very familiar industry is the best night to tell you something similar."}
{"translation": "Let\u2019s take a look at the covers of these exquisite fashion magazines. Do you know who ordered these covers?"}
{"translation": "Which female celebrity can be on this cover? Which motorcycle can be on this cover? Who should decide this?"}
{"translation": "This"}
{"translation": "Someone once said that the edited bei"}
{"translation": "I can tell you that many editors do not have this permission to shoot the cover"}
{"translation": "Because there is always someone higher than him who will tell him that you can\u2019t shoot well, I\u2019ll help you."}
{"translation": "But here comes the problem. The person above me helped you shoot the cover and the magazine was not well shot. Who will bear the responsibility?"}
{"translation": "If you are still the female editor-in-chief enjoying this title for a day, you have to assume the responsibility of the British team for this title."}
{"translation": "Why do you find this responsibility"}
{"translation": "Then your general manager will say why don\u2019t you fight for this authority?"}
{"translation": "So if you call again at this time and say I was treated unfairly"}
{"translation": "Will anyone think that your comprehensive ability is not enough? Give someone a title but you are not able to obtain a corresponding authority. This is your own problem."}
{"translation": "In fact, a recent news incident also said that this problem is the grievance struggle between Zhang Yimou and Zhang Weiping\u2019s hometown."}
{"translation": "The chief director will think that I don\u2019t want to arrange this sex scene. Your investors impressed me with this program. It\u2019s unfair to me."}
{"translation": "This is the problem of some directors\u2019 control over a project, but it\u2019s also very complicated."}
{"translation": "But this problem is the problem of all soil"}
{"translation": "I always hope that this project can make more money, but your bottom line as the producer is that I cannot compromise the quality of this work."}
{"translation": "If you are a master trader, you do not have the ability to control other permissions and interfere with the quality of your product. It can only indicate that there is a problem with your own operating ability."}
{"translation": "This is my second misunderstanding"}
{"translation": "The third misunderstanding of this struggle is that the struggle is all conspiracy without Yang."}
{"translation": "In this case, I have to mention this Gongdou drama Zhen Huan which was very popular some time ago."}
{"translation": "In Zhen Huan\u2019s biography, the main cause of these harem concubines fighting with each other is who slept with the emperor more often, and who can remove the child in the belly of the other concubine\u2019s belly?"}
{"translation": "I often say that it doesn\u2019t matter if you did this thing, as long as the emperor believes that you did it."}
{"translation": "This is the vibration in a typical hostage environment. In a one-man environment, there can only be conspiracy, there can be no Yang, because there are no rules to follow."}
{"translation": "When a person is an emotional animal, he will change"}
{"translation": "If other operations are implemented as a rule, everyone can only conspire"}
{"translation": "So what we advocate is to start in the layout of the western-style building"}
{"translation": "We are also very pleasantly surprised to see that many workplace struggles in China are slowly being vertical. For example, the Gome building was in the previous period, for example, the struggle between Haha Danen."}
{"translation": "Maybe someone would say that they also have pubic hair"}
{"translation": "That can only show that we are not so perfect in the construction of some systems and regulations. Children have been through such constant struggles and constantly painted these regulations and systems."}
{"translation": "It can make the struggles in all our companies move from a sunny to an institutionalized. Only in this way can our entire society be more advanced."}
{"translation": "Finally, I want to talk about a misunderstanding about workplace struggles. All struggles are destruction and no construction."}
{"translation": "Let\u2019s see that this makes them a representative of the Municipal People\u2019s Congress and a member of the CPPCC"}
{"translation": "These two positions are actually a profession and it is still a big and important profession."}
{"translation": "And for them, although this profession is not full-time, at least he can be regarded as an angel night"}
{"translation": "These two practitioners abide by the same rule, that is, I don\u2019t abstain, I don\u2019t vote veto, and I only vote yes."}
{"translation": "I was shocked when I saw the news"}
{"translation": "Because I think they are pretty good-looking. My three-year-old daughter can also feel the same"}
{"translation": "Can I tell my daughter that you don\u2019t move and wait for others to raise their hands."}
{"translation": "I think they may have forgotten this job, what is his job&#39;s job? The job&#39;s job is to speak for the people."}
{"translation": "Is the duty of this job to bring our society to a higher level?"}
{"translation": "So from this perspective, they are actually dereliction of duty"}
{"translation": "They are doing nothing, they should leave this post"}
{"translation": "A workplace that we advocate is a political struggle, that is, we hope that through the struggle of each of us, we will put the rules to make our struggle to the sun."}
{"translation": "I have an American friend who told me you have to move you find because you are right"}
{"translation": "Appreciate his attitude"}
{"translation": "Because I think that if each of us can read for what we think is right and put the right thing that each of us thinks is right on a bright table, then we find that what I think is correct he thinks he is incorrect. I think it&#39;s correct. I think it&#39;s incorrect."}
{"translation": "Then we put all of these opinions together"}
{"translation": "Through communication and compromise, we will formulate some more detailed rules so that the rights of each of us are fully respected for what everyone thinks is right. Our society, our company, and our industry will move towards a brighter future."}
{"translation": "So are you ready"}
{"translation": "you find because you are right"}
{"translation": ""}
