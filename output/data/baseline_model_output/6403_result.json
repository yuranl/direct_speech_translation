{"translation": "Two days ago, a male classmate called me to ask me, please add. I heard that you are going to give a speech on the 29th. Boys are rubbish."}
{"translation": "Think boys are really useless. Life is short. Will our girls still save them so hard?"}
{"translation": "This call has a background"}
{"translation": "Last year our class organized a theme class that would save boys"}
{"translation": "The school is considered to be a good school. Our class is the class with the best grades in the whole year, but we often find these phenomena"}
{"translation": "In the class activities, all the PPT work is girls, including the scripts of this event. Girls are always cleaning the class hygiene. The ones who persist in the end are also girls and boys. That\u2019s long gone."}
{"translation": "The grades are often better for girls"}
{"translation": "The majority of girls and teachers can\u2019t help but feel deeply worried about where all our good boys have gone."}
{"translation": "I want to call the boys theme class will be released smoothly"}
{"translation": "Every boy is under a lot of pressure and seems to take the initiative to talk about how he should be a good boy and talk about his plans for the future"}
{"translation": "They also invited my dad to give a speech as a successful man"}
{"translation": "Of course I don\u2019t think he is such a successful person"}
{"translation": "As a successful person, he can set an example for boys and inspire everyone"}
{"translation": "Girls are just talking about the bones and bones. It can be said that the whole presentation condenses our girls\u2019 ardent expectation and care for boys."}
{"translation": "After the conclusion, our girls and teachers agreed that this conference was a great success"}
{"translation": "Later, we also held events such as the top ten best boys for girls&#39; votes. Let girls vote for good boys. How can they make up for boys?"}
{"translation": "I heard that time is the best way to test emotional engagement"}
{"translation": "Sure enough, today, one year later, our girls are still working hard to make PPT"}
{"translation": "Last August I participated in Ge&#39;s coming-of-age ceremony"}
{"translation": "During the season of raising Liu Huo, I and nearly 70 teenagers from across the country stepped onto the arm and embarked on the most difficult part of Xuanzang\u2019s westward journey to learn Buddhist scriptures."}
{"translation": "88 kilometers to be completed in four days"}
{"translation": "After all, I have been a monitor for several years. After all, I have experienced a vigorous action to save boys. Therefore, I was mentally prepared to become a Gobi girl before the last time."}
{"translation": "When I was next door, I found that the number of boys facing physics is far more than girls, and the captain washing hands, etc. are all boys. I began to worry about my team."}
{"translation": "He is one of the thinnest boys in the team and our vanguard."}
{"translation": "Once we got a little lost and don&#39;t know how to go afterwards"}
{"translation": "At this time, he took the initiative to ask Ying to ask me to find the way"}
{"translation": "If you really get lost in a place like Gobi where Mo Huangsha is given, it\u2019s not a joke"}
{"translation": "But he is still on the road"}
{"translation": "We were really excited when his thin figure appeared next to a certain boulder again"}
{"translation": "Let them give us a good news, but when we walk back to noon"}
{"translation": "I am deeply moved by his dedication to the team and his courage"}
{"translation": "Is our captain"}
{"translation": "We are not fair to the more unique team captain at the time."}
{"translation": "That is, we chose the most stable and mature person to be the captain"}
{"translation": "He is our classmate Lin Feng. He is actually a shy person who doesn&#39;t like to talk."}
{"translation": "The longest job as long as it is a joy and pride that he has never experienced before, so he has to walk at the end of the team every day."}
{"translation": "He also needs to assist the team leader to take care of the wounded and remind the team members to replenish water in time"}
{"translation": "Acting as a walkie-talkie, charging treasure, mobile medicine box, etc."}
{"translation": "The work is very tedious and tiring, but we never read the boss on his mature face."}
{"translation": "There are many more reforms than similar boy stories"}
{"translation": "At that time they really became the manly images we girls expected"}
{"translation": "At that time, our girls were at ease to do strict little roses and this was the best time for Gobi roses because we haven\u2019t seen them yet."}
{"translation": "Let\u2019s say there is a character. In super simple terms, a character refers to what a person thinks he is and what kind of behavior mode he has adopted."}
{"translation": "Xiao, an independent man with arms protected, imagined that these words, even a boy who had just set foot on the Gobi, could not help becoming a man."}
{"translation": "It\u2019s the charm of a character that can change a person\u2019s behavior pattern"}
{"translation": "Here is another question, why the tights and the captain can perform better in these men"}
{"translation": "There is also a secondary role positioning, an irreplaceable behavior called role positioning"}
{"translation": "In the Gobi, in our team, the role played by tight-fitting is not only a man, but also our pioneer. This role is only for him."}
{"translation": "52&#39;s jazz is his role positioning"}
{"translation": "The same is true for our captain"}
{"translation": "My role is the captain, so many things can only be done by him"}
{"translation": "1525 can replace this is the role positioning"}
{"translation": "Because of the irreplaceable role positioning, we can turn outstanding into outstanding"}
{"translation": "My real squad leader\u2019s life pressure should start from the sixth grade"}
{"translation": "At that time, the monitor was asked to write a short section of the class every week, and then he got the training on the podium on Monday."}
{"translation": "When I was in sixth grade for the first time holding that flimsy classmate\u2019s medal"}
{"translation": "It&#39;s as nervous as wearing a rabbit"}
{"translation": "At that time, I yelled to myself that you are the squad leader or the squad leader"}
{"translation": "I won&#39;t be nervous anymore"}
{"translation": "Later, when I was promoted, the amount of shift increased and the class work was completed every day. It was often late at night. At this time, I was facing a lot of homework."}
{"translation": "Some of the basic questions that have been done thousands of times in it, sometimes I really want to copy them"}
{"translation": "Women often stay up late and get old"}
{"translation": "Don&#39;t want to go so early"}
{"translation": "But whenever my eyes condition the answer, there is always a voice passing in my heart. You are the squad leader or the squad leader."}
{"translation": "How can I be sorry for the words squad leader"}
{"translation": "So I frankly accepted the fact that I seemed to be getting old earlier than others"}
{"translation": "At the time I didn\u2019t know the concept of role positioning, but now that I think about it, this is indeed the charm of role positioning."}
{"translation": "A person walks on his path without complaint or regret, and will never be afraid of all new winds and rains"}
{"translation": "Do boys really need to be rescued?"}
{"translation": "In my opinion, it is enough if we tell them that you are a man, a vanguard, and a captain."}
