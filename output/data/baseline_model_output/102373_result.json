{"translation": "Hello everyone"}
{"translation": "I am Wu Zhengdan, the founder of Shoulder Ballet"}
{"translation": "Because I was an athlete from the age of six to the age of 56"}
{"translation": "Six to 16 years old is the happiest childhood period in my life"}
{"translation": "But this is for all the kids but not for me"}
{"translation": "When I was six years old, one of the most basic things I did was to be in pain every day"}
{"translation": "But these have laid a very good foundation for me"}
{"translation": "I have a good physical condition, I have good abilities and good flexibility"}
{"translation": "Only by doing these well can I be able to be what I am today"}
{"translation": "Later, I was eliminated for various reasons. I was sent to the team. Ji Qiao still has a sport for skill."}
{"translation": "I have known my partner since I was six years old"}
{"translation": "Of course at that time we didn\u2019t know that the future was our partner and he was also my husband"}
{"translation": "Later, by coincidence, the two of us were teamed up by the teacher and became collaborators in two mixed-skills duo projects."}
{"translation": "I am very afraid of him bullying me or even hitting me"}
{"translation": "But for the first time after I saw him, I told him that I said it was okay for me to talk to you, but you must promise me three conditions. The first is not to beat me, the second is not to scold me, and the third is not to talk about me."}
{"translation": "Why can&#39;t we decline"}
{"translation": "Because this project has a high altitude"}
{"translation": "Lifted up"}
{"translation": "If the people below are not happy, it is possible to say about the above"}
{"translation": "He also agreed to my request and kept his promise"}
{"translation": "So we cooperated like this since 1992 until now, he has been my great"}
{"translation": "This is my life partner"}
{"translation": "I fell off his shoulder during a competition in 1996. As a result, I slipped and dragged my head to the ground."}
{"translation": "I almost became Sang Lan"}
{"translation": "But also because of this accident"}
{"translation": "I was very fortunate to be spotted by the leaders of the Guangzhou Military Region Soldier Acrobatic Troupe"}
{"translation": "They invited us to Guangzhou and I started a new path in Guangzhou"}
{"translation": "I never thought I would become an acrobat"}
{"translation": "So when I came to another one, I didn\u2019t even know where my direction was."}
{"translation": "Because when I was performing abroad, we were just a skill project for two people"}
{"translation": "One re-arranged and then performed abroad"}
{"translation": "There is a very famous ballet master who is also the head of the Royal Danish Ballet. After seeing our work"}
{"translation": "He said these two actors are so beautiful they are like two princes and princesses of Barre"}
{"translation": "Just because of his words"}
{"translation": "But I wonder if I can try to wear a pair of pointe shoes"}
{"translation": "How come I put on these pointe shoes and started my first step but I stood up on my toes on the ground"}
{"translation": "But I just stand up on the ground, how am I going"}
{"translation": "Not a professional ballerina"}
{"translation": "Because they started at the age of 10"}
{"translation": "I&#39;m almost 20 years old by this time"}
{"translation": "So, from the beginning of creating this show for shoulder ballet, it doesn\u2019t mean that you knew to stand in this position from the beginning."}
{"translation": "But step by step I am on my lover on my partner&#39;s body"}
{"translation": "Every inch of skin has my footprints"}
{"translation": "Because he lay on the ground and served me*"}
{"translation": "Of course it&#39;s painful, this process is very difficult"}
{"translation": "At that time, we wanted to combine with people how to combine"}
{"translation": "Only go to the person to combine with him"}
{"translation": "But which position on the body can stand on these are things that we have never thought about"}
{"translation": "We can only try the largest area on the body"}
{"translation": "Then one position is on the man\u2019s back"}
{"translation": "What should I do if I feel that the younger generation is not difficult enough?"}
{"translation": "On the shoulders"}
{"translation": "But where do you stand on your shoulders"}
{"translation": "Watching or standing"}
{"translation": "Finally, after thousands of attempts, we feel that only this muscle can not touch the bone and the area that can be at this position is the largest"}
{"translation": "So we ended up at this place"}
{"translation": "But at this position, the picture that everyone sees is only one millimeter away from the front and back, and I will fall off"}
{"translation": "I do it every day in failure"}
{"translation": "Why is there a picture like this"}
{"translation": "This is the shallowness of my spouse&#39;s family"}
{"translation": "Every day is bloody because my two feet are on his body, turning and turning around and rubbing here repeatedly every day"}
{"translation": "The toe of my pointe shoes is full of blood and pus"}
{"translation": "In the hot weather like Guangzhou, I finished training every day on the second day. The little thin layer on the top knotted a layer of height."}
{"translation": "One action against me in summer will come down to you"}
{"translation": "But I do it like this every day should be no less than 100 times, hundreds of times"}
{"translation": "Why"}
{"translation": "Actually, I don\u2019t think this kind of pain is a big deal"}
{"translation": "Because of this hardship, we can all bear it as an actor or an athlete"}
{"translation": "Dad broke my foot, I plan to shut down, I can rush up"}
{"translation": "But the most terrifying thing is confusion"}
{"translation": "Why"}
{"translation": "Because we have no direction"}
{"translation": "No teacher can tell me whether this is right or wrong"}
{"translation": "I have no action essentials, I have no technical requirements"}
{"translation": "I don\u2019t know how to overcome these problems"}
{"translation": "I don\u2019t know how well I did it today and I don\u2019t know how it\u2019s done tomorrow."}
{"translation": "So every day in this confusion"}
{"translation": "The two of us were in love at that time, but we almost separated because of this work"}
{"translation": "Because I&#39;m fighting every day, conflicting, arguing, complaining and complaining."}
{"translation": "We all hope to succeed but we can&#39;t find a direction"}
{"translation": "What&#39;s more, I&#39;m confused about what the result will be after this work is released."}
{"translation": "Because in the process of training, everything is saying that you are ready to build it, are you tired, are you ready to subvert, are you tired?"}
{"translation": "But we don\u2019t know what the result will be"}
{"translation": "It\u2019s really that kind of feeling is really what I think is the most fearful at that stage"}
{"translation": "Then I feel very lucky that we persevered"}
{"translation": "No matter what difficulties we encountered, we sometimes stopped and sometimes wanted to give up, but in the end we persisted."}
{"translation": "I didn&#39;t rehearse standing on my head"}
{"translation": "We went to many countries to perform later"}
{"translation": "I imagined that he would succeed but I really never thought that he would get such a big recognition and affirmation"}
{"translation": "Without being a Chinese actor, I think I can get the whole world in such an environment because people from all over the world will come here to appreciate it. I feel very proud and proud to be a Chinese actor."}
{"translation": "I started this show from the second half of 1998 until I won this award in 2002"}
{"translation": "Four years in Guangzhou, I can say that a friend hasn\u2019t"}
{"translation": "My wife and I came here from Northeast Liaoning and spent 10 hours in the rehearsal field every day."}
{"translation": "It\u2019s not easy to recall now, but I am also very proud of myself that I have persisted"}
{"translation": "And God is very, very good to me because not everyone can get something with their hard work, but I and I have been recognized"}
{"translation": "And I did something very good"}
{"translation": "And it really fully reflects my conditions, my value and my advantages"}
{"translation": "Now I take it as a deep breath of mine"}
{"translation": "I enjoy a hobby"}
{"translation": "Said I am almost 40 years old now but I am still on stage"}
{"translation": "Although sometimes I feel a little tired, but I think this kind of kind is painful and happy with that kind of enjoyment"}
{"translation": "I enjoy the pleasure that work brings me"}
{"translation": "thank you"}
{"translation": "So what\u2019s going on next is that these are feedbacks from some audiences in our performance"}
{"translation": "We performed 30 consecutive performances at the Shanghai Grand Theater"}
{"translation": "There are very few building blocks in China that can do this. Every audience can stand up and applaud."}
{"translation": "Really i really think so"}
{"translation": "Every time before my performance, I said that when I was standing on the stage because I was tired, I was really tired when I extended dozens of performances in a row. Sometimes I hope the stage lighting can be stopped."}
{"translation": "Can there be a power outage today or something unexpected? I don\u2019t need to talk about it."}
{"translation": "Just such a fantasy"}
{"translation": "But what really started on the stage was"}
{"translation": "Still so devoted and until I finished the last show"}
{"translation": "At the end of 1 hour and 50 minutes, I went on stage and bowed to the audience. When the audience stood up and applauded for me, I felt everything was worth it."}
{"translation": "I think I enjoyed that moment too much"}
{"translation": "It\u2019s just that the previous kind and those things disappeared in smoke, all forgotten"}
{"translation": "If you think this is the happiest moment to be an actor"}
{"translation": "So till now, I\u2019m still obsessed with the stage. My peak time probably lasted until 2008."}
{"translation": "So this time it should be said that the fall from the peak was an accidental pregnancy"}
{"translation": "Should be a good thing"}
{"translation": "But for us, I\u2019m on the stage, when I was at the top, I was not fully mentally prepared, I had a child"}
{"translation": "So when I gave birth to my baby, my figure was deformed"}
{"translation": "My martial arts are all gone"}
{"translation": "I can no longer stand on the stage like before"}
{"translation": "Then the pain of this recovery process is still fresh in my memory."}
{"translation": "Because on 37 degrees in Guangzhou, I wore a mile of weight loss bread with plastic wrap and went for a run in the afternoon in Guangzhou for an hour every day."}
{"translation": "Then stand on singing and eat every day"}
{"translation": "Then every meal I have no matter how many dishes are on the table, I just eat my mouth and I will leave"}
{"translation": "Because only this way I can lose weight quickly"}
{"translation": "I think my love for my own work means that I have reached a state of eating rice at that time."}
{"translation": "Then because why do I need to recover so urgently"}
{"translation": "I found i&#39;m speechless"}
{"translation": "Because I really feel that in addition to what I did 20 years ago so many years ago, one thing I did is to be on stage"}
{"translation": "I found that I can&#39;t do anything else"}
{"translation": "I can only reflect my own value on the stage"}
{"translation": "So I very much hope to be able to return to the stage soon"}
{"translation": "Mine, mine, mine, prepare to chase, I can\u2019t be as soft as before"}
{"translation": "But one thing I\u2019m very fortunate is that I\u2019ve been away from the stage for so long"}
{"translation": "I find that sometimes in life you may not always be on the stage and you will get better and better"}
{"translation": "Stopped this year I think I have achieved different results"}
{"translation": "My life my stage experience"}
{"translation": "I feel different"}
{"translation": "When I express to the audience, I feel that my emotions and my thoughts convey another kind of information."}
{"translation": "Everyone said Zheng Dan, you have sublimated again, you have improved again"}
{"translation": "I think it means that when a person reaches a different age, the harvest is different and the feeling is different."}
{"translation": "Later, I felt that there are a lot of such utilitarians who don\u2019t practice the character length. I don\u2019t think I can feel it until a certain age."}
{"translation": "This is one of my feelings"}
{"translation": "Why later I returned to the stage and got this Ulannova fake in Russia"}
{"translation": "This award is a very rare event for all dancers"}
{"translation": "As an acrobat, I should be regarded as a cross-border actor who can get this honor."}
{"translation": "I&#39;m very proud and I also cherish"}
{"translation": "So now I\u2019m not just an actor, I\u2019m more of an inheritor and a lighter"}
{"translation": "Because my responsibility and obligation is to inherit and develop such a miracle created by the Chinese ballet on my shoulders."}
{"translation": "In addition, I also trained many children"}
{"translation": "I hope these children can realize their dreams and I can help them"}
{"translation": "At the same time, I also believe that the children who learn to dance must be the strongest and most able to endure hardship"}
{"translation": "Then I believe they will succeed in anything they do in the future"}
{"translation": "It should be said that it is the ultimate perfection that can never be achieved, but every moment in the unremitting pursuit of perfection is the magic of ballet"}
{"translation": "I want to say that for the first half of my life, I am very grateful for my previous encounters in ballet"}
{"translation": "I\u2019m very proud of standing on the stage now, standing on my husband\u2019s shoulders"}
{"translation": "I think I&#39;m invincible at that moment"}
{"translation": "thank you all"}
