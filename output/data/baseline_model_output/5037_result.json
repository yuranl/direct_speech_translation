{"translation": "Let&#39;s start from the marriage relationship"}
{"translation": "At a grand wedding, the bride\u2019s mother said something very heartfelt to the bride and groom on the stage"}
{"translation": "He said that the two of you are from different places and have different living habits. Now that you form a family, then you have to know the number of people in the future. Hold your hand and grow old with your son. Then you must know that the true meaning of this marriage is to tolerate each other. 0.5 plus 0.5 equals how many"}
{"translation": "The guest who will speak after you have finished speaking may be like listening to this. You will say that this experience of this marriage for many years has found the true meaning of marriage."}
{"translation": "But wait, is it true?"}
{"translation": "Is true marriage equal to 0.5 plus 0.5 equals one?"}
{"translation": "I was originally a complete 1"}
{"translation": "If tolerance is due to this multiplying by 0.5, then in this society we don\u2019t want marriage and we can live well, why should we enter marriage?"}
{"translation": "Then our close relationship research tells you that 0.5 plus 0.5 is equal to the product of a process in which we regard marriage as the ultimate goal of old age together."}
{"translation": "If today we think that marriage is very important, the meaning is that I hope to get my happiness in marriage and get my growth"}
{"translation": "Such a good intimacy must be a raincoat for a family"}
{"translation": "It\u2019s not that this mother made no mistake at all because we have to face various differences in our region."}
{"translation": "Who said that men and women\u2019s parents\u2019 preparations are different from our generation, and we and our children are different"}
{"translation": "One of women\u2019s favorite games is a guessing game"}
{"translation": "After many years of marriage and life, it will be a major holiday, our birthday, and our husband will ask us what kind of gifts do you want this year"}
{"translation": "We say whatever"}
{"translation": "We don&#39;t tell him because I want to be worse"}
{"translation": "Our husband is often puzzled by style, he will always make mistakes"}
{"translation": "We feel very disappointed because the highest state of affection in our women\u2019s minds is that I don\u2019t say anything, you know it, that means you love me"}
{"translation": "But the man, this animal, is very strange that he doesn&#39;t have this kind of thinking"}
{"translation": "He said you don\u2019t say anything, how could I know that I\u2019m not the roundworm in your stomach"}
{"translation": "Life because of this difference in perennial marriages"}
{"translation": "I feel hurt because we think you don\u2019t understand me so much. How can you do it like this? I think you don\u2019t love me."}
{"translation": "Marriage becomes cold and tired, so the problem of difference must be solved by us"}
{"translation": "Help me do anthropology for myself. In fact, I think that Mr. Fei Xiaotong summarized a few words in ethnic studies when he was doing democracy research. I think this is the best interpretation of him."}
{"translation": "Calling a beautiful beauty"}
{"translation": "He proposed it when he was doing ethnology. His idea is that each nation has its own standard values and orientations."}
{"translation": "This value orientation and standards are often wrong or even disgusting in the eyes of another nation"}
{"translation": "In the early days that the group proposed, a strong nation would force another nation to change and adapt to me."}
{"translation": "In this process, ethnic conflicts continue to erupt, and there is no way to coexist harmoniously between people."}
{"translation": "At that time we will find that after many contacts of the nation, we will discover that your beauty and your value standards are different from mine, but he is also reasonable."}
{"translation": "This exchange Chinese will find that it is not only like this. One day, I found out that your dances and your religious beliefs are also what I will like."}
{"translation": "Then we continue to communicate with this further understanding, we defeated the mold and we began to appreciate the difference"}
{"translation": "We find that the world has become so beautiful because of this difference and diversity"}
{"translation": "Then we can truly realize the harmonious society proposed by our party leadership"}
{"translation": "Used in family life is actually exactly the same"}
{"translation": "It&#39;s just easier said than done"}
{"translation": "Let&#39;s talk about a few examples"}
{"translation": "Maybe everyone recognizes it as the actor of our most famous cheating incident last year."}
{"translation": "Used to be a very outstanding young man. His artistic talents are very good. Goodbye."}
{"translation": "His father Li Shuangjiang once mentioned his talent in Luyu\u2019s appointment."}
{"translation": "I always hope that my child can grow up freely. I want him to have the energy of love"}
{"translation": "That&#39;s why his book can perform so well"}
{"translation": "He said that his mother often placed strict demands on him. I told him that you were wrong. The child can only develop well if he develops his art freely."}
{"translation": "When a lot of things happened one day than the other day, we still said in a swarm that Jiang was wrong because you were wrong, so he pitted you because you love your children too much"}
{"translation": "We look back and think"}
{"translation": "Isn\u2019t it right for the three children to develop freely and give him room for development?"}
{"translation": "We know that in the middle of a child\u2019s growth process, we need to know what the rules are. Someone must tell him strictly what you should do. In fact, these rules are necessary."}
{"translation": "At the same time, he also needs another way to give him freedom to grow"}
{"translation": "The same education is actually needed for a child"}
{"translation": "So it\u2019s not that it\u2019s always bad, and it\u2019s not that you\u2019re calling it must be bad"}
{"translation": "The mobile terminal is not good"}
{"translation": "But for children, he actually needs two kinds of education"}
{"translation": "The two differences must coexist and cannot kill each other&#39;s mother and attack each other"}
{"translation": "This is the idea of each being beautiful"}
{"translation": "We want it to exist because it has always existed for a reason"}
{"translation": "But it\u2019s really hard to do it. I find it hard to do it."}
{"translation": "From my own story"}
{"translation": "When my child was in elementary school, he took a mathematics test score when he came back. I saw that their school passed the 80-point test and the score line was not 20 points."}
{"translation": "Then I will tell the child that I love the baby. Let\u2019s analyze why you are wrong. Is there any way to improve the explanation?"}
{"translation": "It\u2019s very pleasant. I think I\u2019m doing very well."}
{"translation": "Because I&#39;m an expert in this field, I didn&#39;t criticize him"}
{"translation": "I&#39;m back at this time"}
{"translation": "He said mathematics is my specialty or show me him like this"}
{"translation": "Why this question is wrong"}
{"translation": "I\u2019ve heard something wrong. Can you count it right? It\u2019s definitely not counted as a mistake."}
{"translation": "He was 70 and you got 99 points"}
{"translation": "It&#39;s not enough"}
{"translation": "It\u2019s not that I also know that it\u2019s wrong to say that the two of us are different"}
{"translation": "Let me see the effect"}
{"translation": "As a result, our children&#39;s math grades and understanding are going up"}
{"translation": "He said he thought it was right. Actually I didn\u2019t do better"}
{"translation": "But he needs methods, but perhaps more importantly, he needs confidence"}
{"translation": "So I found that the beauty of the beauty means that in fact, other people\u2019s differences are more different. It may be right."}
{"translation": "It\u2019s like being in love is different from getting married"}
{"translation": "Before we got married, we found out that our husband is so generous. There are buddies and many friends. After we got married, we said why you don\u2019t take care of your family. Why do you have so many outside things to do?"}
{"translation": "Seven characteristics occur in different scenarios"}
{"translation": "Xiaoniaoyi listens to everything. You think it\u2019s so beautiful and so special. After you\u2019re married, you\u2019ll find out how he can\u2019t do everything and you have to rely on you. You\u2019re tired."}
{"translation": "The same feature in different scenes"}
{"translation": "The beauty of beauty is to see the advantages more"}
{"translation": "In fact, it is difficult for you to change this characteristic of a person"}
{"translation": "When its advantages are long, this feature will happen more in the right field."}
{"translation": "Poor will bring more benefits"}
{"translation": "I have lived in the U.S. for a long time"}
{"translation": "Then, because I\u2019m blind, the water is not good when he goes out. I know the traffic in the United States is very good, but I never even thought about driving."}
{"translation": "That he called a car is still a terrible thing at work in the U.S."}
{"translation": "Last year in October 2012, my husband and I went to Los Angeles for five days"}
{"translation": "CITIC has two days and he said he is going to San Francisco once"}
{"translation": "My idea is really bad, just fly over"}
{"translation": "He said he was going to rent a car and drive over"}
{"translation": "Seven hours from Los Angeles to San Francisco is 14 hours back and forth"}
{"translation": "It\u2019s horrible for me to play back and forth for 14 hours in two days"}
{"translation": "I said but don\u2019t go, I say now I\u2019m going"}
{"translation": "Because he accompanied me to the United States that time, he accompanied me to a meeting. If he was with me, then I should make a compromise, and then we would live in two cars and go on the road."}
{"translation": "I found out that the road from Los Angeles to San Francisco is so beautiful"}
{"translation": "Very beautiful and gives me a special feeling"}
{"translation": "In the car, I believe that he also told me about his understanding of life in the United States. It turns out that there are some dreams. Your dreams are like this."}
{"translation": "If there is no my husband, there is no difference between him and me, using my life I will never try this way, I will never find that beauty"}
{"translation": "But because he was different from me, I started to have two worlds"}
{"translation": "When we see the problem, there are two solutions"}
{"translation": "We have two ways for your children"}
{"translation": "When you see any problem, mom will say this is what you do, dad says you do it like that"}
{"translation": "Or it\u2019s better to combine your two paths to see how to do it."}
{"translation": "Our lives are made special because of differences, special, beautiful, special and interesting"}
{"translation": "This is the beauty after the beauty of the mole"}
{"translation": "At this point, we will find that the true clean-up relationship is not to say that I can\u2019t live without you."}
{"translation": "Still saying that I can live well without you"}
{"translation": "I live better with you I feel better because of me you will be better too"}
{"translation": "At this time, the positive energy of intimacy can be fully utilized"}
{"translation": "We are only willing to deal with these differences if there is the energy of love in the intimate relationship"}
{"translation": "Only in the close relationship that we continue to collide do we know that the original manifestation is here, and the compromise is here."}
{"translation": "Vietnamese beauty is here, the original harmonious relationship is there"}
{"translation": "We live in this case and at the same time we use to feel the wonderful scenery of the other side"}
{"translation": "From today on, let us learn to respect him, enjoy the difference and experience the diverse and beautiful life"}
{"translation": "thanks"}
