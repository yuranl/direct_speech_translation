{"translation": "I am Linpin. I am both an observer of the two-dimensional culture and a participant of the two-dimensional culture."}
{"translation": "I believe everyone here has heard of the concept of 2000 more or less."}
{"translation": "But maybe everyone may not all understand where the concept of the second element came from and why it became popular"}
{"translation": "If we trace the etymology of the second element, we will find that this word is actually a word from Japan"}
{"translation": "In Japan, he was originally a technical term in the field of geometry, which means two-dimensional space and two-dimensional world."}
{"translation": "Today we are going to specifically discuss the second element as a buzzword on the Internet. In fact, it was not until the mid-1990s that it obtained its semantics and its usage."}
{"translation": "In Minecraft, we can trace the source of all evil back to a good animation called Mobile Battleship Nadeshiko which was first broadcast in 1996."}
{"translation": "This is a sci-fi cartoon with the background of the story set at the end of the 22nd century"}
{"translation": "There are a group of particularly interesting characters in this cartoon"}
{"translation": "They were a long, long time ago. In fact, what is said here is a long, long time ago, as long as it is the 21st century. They are the descendants of a group of human immigrants who were cooked on Jupiter by the earth\u2019s civilization in the 21st century."}
{"translation": "When their ancestors were cooked to Jupiter, they carried a 3D cartoon called Kekan Man with them."}
{"translation": "For a long time, these three uninhibited and touching ones have become an exceptionally special existence in the Mu News list."}
{"translation": "Because of these people, they not only enthusiastically worship and serve as the people declared by Sanjiang Machine to be their own life creed, but they are also deeply obsessed with the heroine of this cartoon."}
{"translation": "Caicai is her own dream goddess"}
{"translation": "However, these people who are eager to have contact with the prince can never realize their wishes. Why?"}
{"translation": "Because just like us off the screen and the person named Mou on the screen, after all, we are in two distinct worlds."}
{"translation": "Among them, the mother who is an animation audience is in two completely separate events from the wife who is an animation character in the middle distance."}
{"translation": "Oh, everyone can feel that this is an insurmountable physical and physiological limitation"}
{"translation": "Faced with such a restriction, these people who are deeply trapped in Wuwan Sports can only persuade each other"}
{"translation": "Although the prince is good, it is a woman of the second dimension after all"}
{"translation": "I don\u2019t know if this line resonated deeply with everyone"}
{"translation": "When I saw this line for the first time, he laughed. He was a deep machine. My sympathy was"}
{"translation": "And when it was broadcast in Japan, he also aroused a lot of Japanese anime and game lovers called otaku. Their supply"}
{"translation": "Everyone can think about that we have all deeply loved some animated characters, comic characters, and game characters."}
{"translation": "But it is absolutely impossible for us to have physical or physical contact with these characters we love"}
{"translation": "Because these characters are our profound characters, after all, they only exist in the virtual world composed of Ovi line plane images and dynamic pictures."}
{"translation": "Because this line is so persistent and the concept of the second element is so precise and concise to highlight the dimensional difference that separates us from them highlights the media characteristics that make them appear so special."}
{"translation": "Therefore, since the mid-1990s, more and more animation game enthusiasts have borrowed the concept of two dimensions to refer to the two-dimensional virtual world created by each piece of animation, comics, games, etc."}
{"translation": "Anyway, the point you want to emphasize is that we look at the person for this purpose, but when he used the concept for 20 years, many anime game enthusiasts use the concept of two-dimensional, they seem to often separate the two-dimensional and the three-dimensional."}
{"translation": "That is to separate the two-dimensional virtual world from the three-dimensional reality event that we are in between."}
{"translation": "It seems that this constitutes a kind of opposition between truth and falsehood"}
{"translation": "But if you understand the potential context of the sentence"}
{"translation": "In fact, he deeply expressed his sincere and strong love for the two-dimensional world and the two-dimensional characters."}
{"translation": "This is a kind of affection that makes them earnestly desire to have real contact with the prince."}
{"translation": "It is this kind of love, but they devoutly regard the touching spirit as their life creed."}
{"translation": "According to my observation and experience of the two-dimensional culture"}
{"translation": "We can also notice that in the sense of reincarnation in the mind rather than physical reincarnation, many anime game enthusiasts often get quite sincere emotional experience from the world of the second dimension."}
{"translation": "Even compared to the three-dimensional society that needs to take some kind of mask to deal with yang and yin violations."}
{"translation": "Their emotional investment in the two-dimensional world may be more sincere and strong"}
{"translation": "It seems that the relationship between the positive and the real and the virtual cannot be simply distinguished by the dualistic thinking framework."}
{"translation": "Perhaps the question that is more worthy of follow-up is"}
{"translation": "Why do so many people have such sincere and strong emotional involvement in objects that are often called virtual characters in the virtual world"}
{"translation": "Here I will introduce an academic theoretical term to help me explain and interpret such a social and cultural trend."}
{"translation": "When I was undergraduate, there was an experienced senior or an elder who taught me this way. He said that postmodernism is wide and everything can be installed inside."}
{"translation": "I am here to share with you a theoretical concept. Postmodern is actually a concept with divergent opinions."}
{"translation": "People with viruses will have different ways of using them, and different arguments will be filled with different theoretical connotations."}
{"translation": "Then I\u2019m here to help me share the concept with you, in what specific sense did I use it?"}
{"translation": "I am learning from the usage of this fat mansion on the right behind you and me, a Japanese otaku cultural research expert named Dongdong Hao Ji"}
{"translation": "In other words, it is borrowing from the French postmodernist philosopher Lie, who asked him for his statement."}
{"translation": "The current situation after calling them first means the decline of the grand narrative"}
{"translation": "What is a grand narrative?"}
{"translation": "The grand narrative here refers to a series of conceptual systems that unite its members in the modern political community since the Enlightenment."}
{"translation": "They provide authoritative explanations for the operating rules of society"}
{"translation": "They give transcendence value and meaning to the practice of human beings. They arrive at a consistent narrative of the development process of history."}
{"translation": "But in the great historical changes of the 20th century"}
{"translation": "Some grand narratives that have a supporting significance for modern civilization gradually lose their persuasiveness and appeal"}
{"translation": "From the outbreak of the First World War to the end of the Cold War, in this extreme age, one after another tragic and traumatic historical events almost destroyed the trust building of humanistic enlightenment rationality and historical progress theory."}
{"translation": "The replacement of liberal capitalism and modern technology has made the entire society full of fluidity and highly fragmented, while also largely dispelling the social foundation of some grand narratives."}
{"translation": "As the grand narrative of modernity collapses and disintegrates in the postmodern state"}
{"translation": "What we are ushering in is a vacuum of cultural values"}
{"translation": "Just like those Jupiter people who were banished to Jupiter were cut off the spiritual connection between their own earth civilizations."}
{"translation": "Those of us who are in the post-modern situation are finally exposed to it and growing up, it is also difficult for us to smoothly and convincingly connect our spiritual world to the grand narrative that modern civilization once tried to construct."}
{"translation": "It is precisely in this era that the two-dimensional culture played a very important role in the advance list for us to play a very important spiritual effect."}
{"translation": "In the two-dimensional culture, it is like the life of Jigang has filled the spiritual and cultural value vacuum of those Jupiter people. There are many excellent two-dimensional works. They often tell a fascinating story while providing a set of worldview settings that are compatible with Kangcheng&#39;s grand view. system"}
{"translation": "These worldview setting systems provide some alternative grand narratives for those who are in the ruins of grand narratives in their own unique ways. We can also call them the grand narrative of the second dimension."}
{"translation": "Of course, the piano enthusiasts are composed of diverse forms, but in terms of my personal acceptance experience"}
{"translation": "In my mind, the most attractive part of the two-dimensional element is precisely the compensatory spiritual effect exerted by the grand narrative of the two-dimensional element."}
{"translation": "This Dragon Ball or You Yu Hakusho that can\u2019t come out of street comics for a price of five cents since I was a kid"}
{"translation": "Naruto Digimon that I watched on my desktop through the TV when I was a teenager"}
{"translation": "Then this year, I will contact the boiling magical girl Madoka through a tablet, a laptop, and a smartphone."}
{"translation": "These two-dimensional cultural works that I deeply love and make me deeply indulged. They tend to break the boundaries between the so-called traditional and modern Eastern and Western secular and mysterious technology and magic."}
{"translation": "The various elements of knocking down the floor have cast a set of magnificent worldview setting system"}
{"translation": "Under the care of such a two-dimensional world view, technology is no longer boring and cold, but seems to become pan-necked and magical."}
{"translation": "At the same time, it cannot and does not constitute an evocation of pre-modern ghosts, but a spectacle garden that uses emerging media to gain fascinating charm."}
{"translation": "This kind of worldview setting allows those characters that we may identify and bring into have extraordinary abilities."}
{"translation": "And experience all kinds of wonderful encounters in a magnificent and interesting time and space"}
{"translation": "These wonderful encounters of mine will be a kind of visual effect that the emerging media such as animation games are not crazy and cool."}
{"translation": "Therefore, they constitute a kind of pleasure reactor, just like someone who produces a powerful development pleasure reactor to provide an endless stream of pleasure for those comic readers, animated audiences, and game players."}
{"translation": "More importantly, for me, sports that take place under the setting of these two-dimensional worldviews are often given a certain connected community destiny and even great significance of the destiny of the world during the unfolding of the storyline."}
{"translation": "At the same time, the characters are placed in a relatively extreme situation to take the amount of emotion that stimulates the bonds between the characters."}
{"translation": "The fetter I am talking about here is a two-dimensional term, it can only be a strong and profound emotional connection between people"}
{"translation": "For me, there is a kind of virtual reality routine that is common and tried repeatedly."}
{"translation": "As the world-scale crisis continues to deepen, the bond between the characters is constantly facing dangers and tests that are close to life and death."}
{"translation": "In order to maintain this fragile but must be guarded chicken in extreme situations* those we will identify and bring into the two-dimensional role"}
{"translation": "The link that must be in English is the key to stimulate potential. The painting demonstrates that the energy field contained in the inner universe is to save the external heavy rain while being fettered by each other."}
{"translation": "Why does such a way of gaining momentum hit me so often"}
{"translation": "In my opinion, it is because the prajna is able to successfully create a good substitute for the audience of the sigh animation, the readers of the comics, the readers of the game, and the sincere mainland period, then such a bond may reach emotional strength, but our bodies Two-dimensional enthusiasts in a post-modern situation are difficult to experience in the middle-level three-dimensional life repeated with SLR machines"}
{"translation": "Furthermore, the world view setting and plot design of such a two-dimensional work will also allow many transcendence values that have been lost for me to be expressed at least temporarily within the story frame and emotional structure of the work."}
{"translation": "When I saw that Monkey King elaborated this week, it\u2019s not nonsense, the principle of adaptation, not chaos, I\u2019ll call him her uneasy here."}
{"translation": "When I saw Kakarot, he was constantly surpassing his limits in order to protect his important partner, to protect the earth"}
{"translation": "When I saw Naruto Suiwu constantly enduring hardships and trials that ordinary people can&#39;t imagine in order to realize a world of great harmony where people can understand each other."}
{"translation": "When I saw the Cavaliers disappeared and the civil used their own life\u2019s love for everyone, they would ignore the holy grail between victory and destruction."}
{"translation": "When Kihara sacrificed his life and sacrificed all traces of his existence to reverse the cause and effect of the entire universe, when he brought the ultimate hope for every magical girl who was about to die in despair."}
{"translation": "The enthusiasm and sense of sublime that come from this is also something I can hardly experience in the three-dimensional social atmosphere of nihilism, cynicism, exquisite self-interest, and extreme individualism."}
{"translation": "This is the grand narrative of the second dimension in this sense. For me, it may have played a spiritual compensatory role for many, many fans."}
{"translation": "For two-dimensional enthusiasts, we often hear some severe elders make such human criticisms"}
{"translation": "For example, you are escaping from reality"}
{"translation": "For example, you are addicted to virtual"}
{"translation": "But in my opinion, let\u2019s observe and understand the painting from another angle"}
{"translation": "If the grand narrative of modernity no longer has truthful meaning and value for us"}
{"translation": "If we have avoided the unavoidable being among a kind of real ruins"}
{"translation": "So can we also understand the hobby of the second element as a flexible spiritual pursuit"}
{"translation": "Or understood as an immersive experience of a hyper-real world that is more real than reality"}
{"translation": "What I told him is so prosperous, especially when I give an example, maybe many, many friends here will think that I am a good person."}
{"translation": "As a two-dimensional enthusiast who has seen many battles"}
{"translation": "When facing a three-dimensional friend, he is often accused of being recognized as being taunted by a patient with secondary disease"}
{"translation": "However, you can rest assured that Chinese patients like me are actually only one of the types and may even be an old-fashioned type among the diversified two-dimensional fans."}
{"translation": "What I\u2019m going to talk about next may make many three-dimensional people even more uneasy."}
{"translation": "Because we can observe that since the 1990s, it is not only the cynicism of the posterity era that has permeated the world."}
{"translation": "Moreover, as far as the specific social context of Japanese society is concerned, the Japanese people have encountered a kind of bubble economy. The bursting of the economy has come. The long-term economic stagnation has made it known as the Heisei Great Depression."}
{"translation": "At the age when they grew up in the era of the Great Depression, they faced the solidified reality of the class, faced with the fate of a benign interaction between their struggle and the journey of history, they would inevitably fall into a heavy sense of emptiness, but the middle line was heavy. Sighing powerlessly"}
{"translation": "At the same time, these young people who are as perplexed and decadent as the hero of Neon Genesis Evangelion Dingjinji are living in a post-industrial consumer society."}
{"translation": "They can access the rich and diverse cultural consumer products produced by the highly developed cultural and creative industries for them in batches and segmentation at any time and anywhere, and get pleasure and comfort from these consumer product lists."}
{"translation": "Under such a background of the times, a group of otakus, who were called or grew up as abandoned houses in Heisei, appeared."}
{"translation": "In the words of Dong Hiroki, this is a group of eras that have emerged in a more thorough postmodern situation that do not require a grand narrative."}
{"translation": "So the question is which one is the best mining technology"}
{"translation": "Smoked meat pathogenic sugar"}
{"translation": "Excavator you deserve"}
{"translation": "Hey, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m the Chinese disease. I have food here. This is a mess."}
{"translation": "problem"}
{"translation": "The question is if these otakus don\u2019t even need the grand narrative of the second dimension, then what is the profit driving them to make the second dimension consumption?"}
{"translation": "According to Dong Hao Ji&#39;s statement, it is neither the superficial story nor the deep world view setting that really provides the driving force for their cultural consumption."}
{"translation": "It is a two-dimensional character who can be extracted from the story situation in the pure present story"}
{"translation": "Let these characters be continuously copied in the Mongolian element database of the promotion"}
{"translation": "Before explaining this new concept of the cute element database, there is no need to review a very important industrial model of the two-dimensional industry."}
{"translation": "Everyone should have heard of this, which is IP operation or Japan, which is often called Mi Tian Mix Qihua"}
{"translation": "For example, after advanced skills become a highly popular comic"}
{"translation": "Soon there will be an animated game adaptation of Advanced Giant and a series of peripheral derivative products"}
{"translation": "For example, after Neon Genesis Evangelion became a popular anime"}
{"translation": "Soon there will be an adaptation of Evangelion comics and a series of peripheral derivative products."}
{"translation": "For example, at the Gate of Destiny"}
{"translation": "After becoming a highly popular game, it soon had its adaptations of animated cartoons and a series of peripheral derivative products."}
{"translation": "It is not just the cultural industry of the second dimension that will produce cultural products with multiple media carriers and develop product groups that span multiple media carriers"}
{"translation": "And enthusiasts will also use existing products as user-generated content that I use as a material library to produce a variety of media carriers."}
{"translation": "For example, doujin doujin painting doujin video doujin radio drama doujin game cosplay doujin surrounding handicrafts, etc."}
{"translation": "The problem is here. We can imagine that the storyline in the process of fan-derived in the process of this IP operation is actually constantly changing."}
{"translation": "Even the world view setting is not stable but will derive or hybridize various parallel universes"}
{"translation": "Then what is it that drives the two-dimensional users to travel in the sea of content composed of the IP product chain and the fan fun culture?"}
{"translation": "Judging from the current situation, the most probable answer is not the grand narrative of the second dimension that patients with secondary diseases like me would love."}
{"translation": "It\u2019s the two-dimensional characters who are attracted to the two-dimensional users as deeply as the prince\u2019s attracting new recruits."}
{"translation": "What I want to emphasize here is that these two-dimensional characters can be separated from the story situation and separated from the world view setting and exist independently."}
{"translation": "Popular products like Hatsune Miku or drop-down"}
{"translation": "The role setting of a virtual idol with only one or a group of two-dimensional characters is sufficient to support a product chain that spans multiple media carriers."}
{"translation": "So what makes these characters still maintain the minimum relative consistency for those two-dimensional users who love them when they shuttle between products of different media carriers and parallel universes set by different worldviews?"}
{"translation": "It is the specific combination of labelled non-narrative personal elements in specific characters"}
{"translation": "Or in Dong Hao Ji&#39;s words, it is the specific combination of manganese in a series of manganese elements in a specific role."}
{"translation": "The Mongolian element mentioned here refers to the human element that allows the two-dimensional character to evoke the love of the two-dimensional user"}
{"translation": "In the logic of the highly mature cultural industry"}
{"translation": "Those two-dimensional characters that attract a certain range of users\u2019 personal elements will be analyzed and summarized in a Mongolian element database that can be copied and reproduced by the cultural industry."}
{"translation": "Practitioners in the two-dimensional industry and creators of user-generated content can get what they need from this large-scale Mongolian element database."}
{"translation": "Through the distance of the manganese element, through the reorganization of the gate element, through the single cycle of a certain element, a variety of cute characters are produced"}
{"translation": "Oh my saying this seems very abstract, so let&#39;s give an example"}
{"translation": "Behind me, there are three very popular two-dimensional cute characters"}
{"translation": "On my right, everyone on the left. This is one of the heroines of the landmark animation Evangelion that will be premiered in 1995 tomorrow."}
{"translation": "Then he is also a label-like character with a combination of cute elements like Miss Tsundere Double Ponytail"}
{"translation": "Tsundere Double Horsetail Miss, the response of the manned equipment market proved to be a popular way of manganese element combination, and soon it was also widely adopted in the two-dimensional industry or widely."}
{"translation": "But the adoption he should pay attention to does not mean repetition"}
{"translation": "But in the process of reorganization, new cute characters are generated"}
{"translation": "In the middle, one of the heroines of the fate series who appeared later, Ren Bangling, and the important role in the door of the fate stone door list, is not with meow him."}
{"translation": "They all have a combination of attributes like Tsundere Double Ponytail Miss"}
{"translation": "But he has some new manganese elements that are subtly different from this Asuka. A new combination has taken place, and some new cute characters have been formed."}
{"translation": "Or we can look at Sun Shangxiang in the glory of the king again"}
{"translation": "As a person, please note that he has no direct relationship with the princess Wu in history."}
{"translation": "But as a people drawn from Princess Wu, he was also endowed with a combination of cute elements such as Miss Double Ponytail."}
{"translation": "At the same time, the designer of the game has a setting of using bows and arrows for Sun Shangxiang\u2019s proficiency in reference to historical legends and popular culture."}
{"translation": "For him, he will appear in fate, and he will give you that"}
{"translation": "Refer to such a setting for a double ponytailed lady like Sun Shangxiang and add a collage combination and a single hand-held long-range artillery weapon."}
{"translation": "It can be found that the manganese element combination was established in the setting of the second dimension in a battle that had to break the boundary between historical interpretation and science fiction and fantasy."}
{"translation": "Then we will find that although many, many otakus who have a deep love, they will emphasize that this two-dimensional character that I love is unique."}
{"translation": "However, in the logic of the cultural industry, those symbols that are regarded as the same character in animation, comics, video games and peripheral figure cosplay."}
{"translation": "In fact, it is nothing more than a specific combination of certain manganese elements extracted from the database"}
{"translation": "Or is it the implementation and presentation of the combination of these Mongolian elements in each specific worldview setting story situation and media carrier"}
{"translation": "So why is such a two-dimensional character composed of Mongolian elements collaged to have a continuous attraction to those and the family?"}
{"translation": "An explanation that may be established but I cannot agree without reservation is this"}
{"translation": "Every one of us lives in a society of strangers with highly mobile market employment and large-scale urbanization transformation."}
{"translation": "Such a society makes it easy for each of us to fall into a sense of loneliness and alienation of atomized existence."}
{"translation": "The decline of the grand narrative we just mentioned is the kind of universal and shared social ethical norms that can hardly be established."}
{"translation": "Further exacerbated such a dilemma of atomized survival"}
{"translation": "For these postmodern subjects, whether it is the other person in the interpersonal relationship or the other person as the social rule system"}
{"translation": "It\u2019s hard to serve as a bottle that can provide us and the prince fans with definite answers, but it constitutes one after another troublesome puzzle"}
{"translation": "In this situation, in the two-dimensional world"}
{"translation": "Those diversified but with labels to follow the two-dimensional role of A Zhai digital survival provides a convenient way to obtain affection and satisfaction without going through the intermediary of others."}
{"translation": "Those manganese elements that are both creative and highly targeted to meet the needs can establish a set of fast loops for two-dimensional users between online lack and satisfaction."}
{"translation": "Because of this, the specific combination of these cute elements and these manganese elements"}
{"translation": "The CP combination between Mongolian element combination and Mongolian element combination can effectively serve as the searched keyword"}
{"translation": "Leading two-dimensional users through various styles of search engines to call content resources that meet their needs from the ocean of big data"}
{"translation": "It proves that they can effectively act as a clear and identifiable need. The goal drives these two-dimensional enthusiasts to obtain a relatively stable pleasure from the constantly changing world view setting list of constantly changing story situations according to their own specific tastes. source"}
{"translation": "Such a popular phenomenon not only reminds us of a social and cultural trend worthy of attention, but also raises some very important issues worthy of our further discussion."}
{"translation": "When the fascinating fantasy of the second dimension provides an alternative satisfaction for the artistic and emotional needs of the postmodern subject"}
{"translation": "Is grand narrative no longer necessary for the operation of the human community"}
{"translation": "When those fascinating characters collaged with human elements and digital images are filled with the new media interface of the post-industrial consumer society, are human beings no longer necessary for the establishment of intimacy?"}
{"translation": "Furthermore, with more and more IP operation projects and more and more mid cigarettes, Mix Qihua tries to establish such a whole industry chain that opens up the animation, game, and voice industry."}
{"translation": "With more and more popular products, they combine real-life image materials with computer-synthesized bright digital animations."}
{"translation": "When producing the fascinating fantasies we indulge in"}
{"translation": "As more and more new technologies such as virtual reality technology and augmented reality technology have been commercialized on a large scale"}
{"translation": "The boundary between virtual and real, the boundary between them is becoming more and more blurred and ambiguous"}
{"translation": "What we can actually ask is whether the two concepts of the two-dimensional and three-dimensional, which are based on differences and based on opposition, will also become an outdated concept."}
{"translation": "I can&#39;t give clear answers to these interesting questions"}
{"translation": "Actually, I just want to play a role to inspire others, hoping to inspire more creative and insightful thinking and discussion."}
{"translation": "That\u2019s it for today\u2019s sharing. Thank you very much for listening patiently."}
{"translation": "thanks"}
