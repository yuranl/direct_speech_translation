{"translation": "I am a lawyer"}
{"translation": "A friend asked me a few days ago what is the most impressive thing about you in the industry for more than ten years"}
{"translation": "Mu Ran looks back and enjoys it for himself. It turns out that it is not the case of the target senator or the first few questions in the Supreme People\u2019s Court."}
{"translation": "Can you think of it"}
{"translation": "In fact, a case about 475 clubs and three cents"}
{"translation": "A few years after I first entered this industry in 2005, I brought up a small case"}
{"translation": "My client is from outside"}
{"translation": "Rented out a residential house in our city"}
{"translation": "Later, he needed to check out early due to work transfer issues"}
{"translation": "In other words, it is necessary to submit a request to the landlord to cancel the house lease contract in advance"}
{"translation": "It&#39;s not a big deal"}
{"translation": "My client has a deposit at the landlord\u2019s and both parties settle accounts"}
{"translation": "Niconico should pick up"}
{"translation": "In the end, the landlord should refund my client 475 yuan, three cents."}
{"translation": "He said it&#39;s so simple that you have nothing to talk about"}
{"translation": "But at that time, the landlord was so crazy and tried to refuse to refund the 475 yuan for various reasons."}
{"translation": "The landlord thought, what&#39;s the great thing about you as a foreigner? Don&#39;t even think about taking it for more than 400 yuan."}
{"translation": "My client is willing to eat here, OK?"}
{"translation": "The lawsuit filed with the court by directly entrusting a lawyer to the court brought him to the court"}
{"translation": "This is something that mathematics finds ridiculous and so simple, and it needs to be litigated."}
{"translation": "What&#39;s really unexpected to you is that this landlord actually used local relations"}
{"translation": "In the first instance, he didn\u2019t need to refund the 475 yuan"}
{"translation": "And the uncomfortable person does not feel"}
{"translation": "The lawyer who just entered the industry is a blow"}
{"translation": "Does it directly affect my judgment of my outlook on life and values?"}
{"translation": "In any case, an appeal is to be filed"}
{"translation": "After 20 courts, we tried our best to obtain evidence from multiple parties. Four rounds of negotiations and eight parties dealt with the final judgment."}
{"translation": "Finally asked him to refund"}
{"translation": "But can you think of it? It&#39;s really not that simple"}
{"translation": "The smallest cases have entered the execution stage"}
{"translation": "The execution process is not complicated"}
{"translation": "The judge called both parties and me to the office. Before everyone was on the scene, the landlord asked the landlord to take out 475 yuan in cash and gave it to my tutor on the spot."}
{"translation": "An unexpected thing happened the moment I left the house"}
{"translation": "When I was leaving the house, the landlord\u2019s finger in the car held a missile between my nose and the shoulders of the person. Let\u2019s walk and see."}
{"translation": "My thinking will stop at that moment"}
{"translation": "Is 1 yuan"}
{"translation": "Anyway, the other day I said that the reaction was running out of water"}
{"translation": "Fortunately, I haven\u2019t met this brother for so many years."}
{"translation": "I guess he should not be there today, otherwise it would be really troublesome"}
{"translation": "This incident is not as simple as being dumbfounded in retrospect"}
{"translation": "Why is someone willing to break the rules of our society for 475 yuan? Just about to break the rules of a simple house lease contract"}
{"translation": "Is this kind of psychological impulse inherent in us?"}
{"translation": "China&#39;s reform and opening up for more than 30 years has indeed made significant progress and development in the construction of the rule of law"}
{"translation": "But we often see some weird social phenomena"}
{"translation": "Many of my current services are institutional corporate clients"}
{"translation": "I find that when bosses often encounter problems and disputes, the first thing they think of is the mayor, director and dean Jin Sanchang"}
{"translation": "I often accompany my friends to visit these three because of my work."}
{"translation": "One day I accompanied a friend of mine to visit the president of our local Intermediate People\u2019s Court"}
{"translation": "During the chat, I found that the 50-year-old dean of the accounting department who is known as one of the three leaders is not familiar with many of our current regulations and is accustomed to judging things by experience."}
{"translation": "So I gave the dean a printed copy of the land required by the current regulations on a certain matter."}
{"translation": "Unexpectedly, when the dean looked at this thing, you told me that it\u2019s not a big deal and it\u2019s not the way to revise it."}
{"translation": "At that time you can really understand what Simon brags"}
{"translation": "Why"}
{"translation": "Why our current law enforcers and rulers often have rules and his existence"}
{"translation": "Why do they often use rules and systems as their tools as their daughter-in-law"}
{"translation": "Why do they not have such a sense of awe and admiration for the rules and systems in their hearts"}
{"translation": "Could it be that the power that Xiao said was not locked in a cage?"}
{"translation": "Many strange social phenomena are happening in the current society"}
{"translation": "We just talked about the people who have power for the ruling party. Is it just for ordinary people like us who have no rights? Will they not violate the rules?"}
{"translation": "Won&#39;t overtake the thunder pond for half a step"}
{"translation": "A very strange case occurred in the Northeast about 10 years ago"}
{"translation": "There is a school that organizes teachers to go out for a group tour during the summer vacation"}
{"translation": "When the tourist bus drove to a certain rest area on the national highway, a water-saving water-saving hand-held knife rushed from under the car"}
{"translation": "This is a small water saving, but you are not too old and you are only 14 years old, but the dazzling knife in your hand is still shocking to everyone."}
{"translation": "At the end, from the rear of the car to the front of the car, everyone\u2019s belongings were looted."}
{"translation": "Just when Robber Lin got out of the car, look at the door of the car. A young and beautiful teacher was wearing a string of wonderful vectors on his neck."}
{"translation": "New ecology, this vector that stretches out your hand is on the neck"}
{"translation": "It\u2019s delicious today. There is one more period when the child wants to sexually assault himself, so he starts to resist instinctively."}
{"translation": "The two sides tore Teacher Ning&#39;s clothes during the negotiation"}
{"translation": "You are always anxious to pull a book at hand and slam it on the head of the robber"}
{"translation": "What section of music are you wondering"}
{"translation": "At this time, the more than 20 teachers in the car couldn&#39;t afford to fight and kick the little Jaffe who had lost the ability to resist."}
{"translation": "By the time the festival was sent to the police at the end, it was almost half dead, even if it was a breath."}
{"translation": "Why"}
{"translation": "That is the existence of a rule that more than 20 people who can be called a teacher have completely ignored"}
{"translation": "That is also the demonic nature released by more than 20 people. They have forgotten the existence of social rules and systems."}
{"translation": "Even forget that this is water saving and you have the right to be tried"}
{"translation": "Is there no such feeling of awe and admiration for the rules and systems in the subconscious minds of our people?"}
{"translation": "I think it will"}
{"translation": "We review the ideological and cultural history of the Chinese nation for more than 2,000 years"}
{"translation": "During the Spring and Autumn and Warring States period more than 2500 years ago, our Chinese society was born at the same time as Confucianism, Taoism, Law, Mohism, and other important matters."}
{"translation": "But what I want to say today is the prevailing trend of social Chinese learning, but Chinese learning is by no means the same as Ruxue"}
{"translation": "Let\u2019s talk about the Moffat family today"}
{"translation": "Talking about the understanding and respect of the rules and systems, etc. tens of thousands"}
{"translation": "Wan Jia is a leader of two groups with very strict discipline."}
{"translation": "About 400 AD, the 4th generation heir of the giant during the Warring States Period did not live in Qin Guofu\u2019s son and killed someone"}
{"translation": "All should be put to death"}
{"translation": "But the parents of King Qin Hui at that time were already old and ordered not to kill just such a son."}
{"translation": "However, the master said that there is no law that stipulates the actions of murderers who kill and injure people. This is a necessary method for prohibiting murder and transgression. This is in line with the righteousness of the world."}
{"translation": "So he decided to kill his son anyway"}
{"translation": "This story vividly shows that Wanjiao\u2019s understanding of the rules and systems has reached a level of awe and even belief."}
{"translation": "Isn&#39;t this kind of spirit exactly what we need in a society under the rule of law?"}
{"translation": "Isn&#39;t it even what we need for the management of Chinese enterprises now?"}
{"translation": "But how did this spirit come from"}
{"translation": "I think we need to explore the core of Mohist thought"}
{"translation": "For more than 2000 years, the core of Wanjia\u2019s thought has always been genius"}
{"translation": "Dear thoughts emphasize that the monarch, father, son, brothers and sisters love each other on an equal basis"}
{"translation": "Under this simple concept of equality, the tens of thousands of people have a sense of respect and clearness for the rules and systems, which is what we now call a society under the rule of law."}
{"translation": "We can see that the philosophical thinking outside the shoulders gives an equal social concept. The equal social concept creates a social environment under the rule of law."}
{"translation": "But it is a pity that this important idea did not become the mainstream of society in the future"}
{"translation": "About 2000 years ago, during the Western Han Dynasty in China, a father and son named Dong Zhongshu and his master Han Wudi jointly launched a policy to abolish a hundred schools of Confucianism."}
{"translation": "Under the guidance of this policy, the society adheres to the feudal hierarchy of emperor, monarch, minister, father, son and son"}
{"translation": "This idea is that society cannot learn from things such as scientific research society."}
{"translation": "This concept continues to this day and it is still interesting to participate in today\u2019s Chinese society."}
{"translation": "We can see that there are some people who violate social rules and even illegal laws, but because of their special backgrounds and special identities, they get a special, including special supervision and management."}
{"translation": "Some people have special treatment when they appear in court because they have the background of official family members, including going out and clearing the scene when the police car clears the road near the scenic spot."}
{"translation": "Some people have special identities"}
{"translation": "Find a girlfriend and go to the hotel to open a room, including being photographed by surveillance cameras"}
{"translation": "Looking at our society, what we need more is the concept of free and equal rule of law, but it is hard-won"}
{"translation": "Fortunately, the advent of the Internet era has given us a glimmer of hope and light"}
{"translation": "We found that in the Internet society, everyone can de-identify, decentralize, and communicate on an equal footing."}
{"translation": "In the Internet society, people rely on a simple and useful rule to create a community"}
{"translation": "We can communicate on an equal footing in a community of this kind of equality"}
{"translation": "I believe that the social system is so mighty. The tide of the society is also mighty and propelling us as a whole to find a society based on equality and freedom under the rule of law."}
