{"translation": "Hello everyone"}
{"translation": "Today I am very happy and honored to have the opportunity to share with you the science of beauty"}
{"translation": "It\u2019s not beauty science, of course we have to talk about beauty"}
{"translation": "Aesthetics that cannot be applied to beautiful women are regarded as philosophy, so we have to get this thing right"}
{"translation": "To me today, let\u2019s divide it into two parts. The first part is beautiful, but where the science is. The second part talks about science in every science."}
{"translation": "November 25 is the most beautiful day for me"}
{"translation": "Why beautiful"}
{"translation": "Two reasons"}
{"translation": "One reason is that Einstein published the theory of general relativity 100 years ago on this day, which is the most beautiful scientific theory for me."}
{"translation": "For another reason, everyone also saw my daughter who was born 25 years ago by the most beautiful girl in the world."}
{"translation": "My daughter\u2019s beauty and general relativity tell me what are the commonalities between beauty"}
{"translation": "What can be regular in this"}
{"translation": "This is what I want to share with you today"}
{"translation": "In other words, we have to ask a question what is beauty"}
{"translation": "Well, in fact, these families have asked this question for more than 2,000 years. From the great philosopher Socrates to his student Plato and Lato\u2019s student Aristotle to the current Kant Hegel and so on, this family has asked. this problem"}
{"translation": "This question is called a genius questioning"}
{"translation": "So let\u2019s see what the answer is now after the family asked for more than two days"}
{"translation": "Then of course I plan to have a lot of categories"}
{"translation": "Let\u2019s select the views of estheticians on this issue summarized by Professor Zhu Liyuan of Fudan University"}
{"translation": "Professor Wu said that I don\u2019t think I can answer this question, but Plato said that beauty is male, so beauty is male."}
{"translation": "And I think it\u2019s a very true saying for the input of renting a mobile phone"}
{"translation": "What is beauty every time a man"}
{"translation": "I want to say that beauty is female"}
{"translation": "If we are in class when I teach, classmate An, for example, our classmate of An Elementary School today, then ask me a question, my respected professor, how high is the sun?"}
{"translation": "Then I am from the school of astronomy to ask this question or it is correct"}
{"translation": "I replied, my dear classmate, how real I am"}
{"translation": "In the knot, how many stars are there in the sky"}
{"translation": "I&#39;ll come back again, N many N many"}
{"translation": "You can remember that we have a beautiful woman Yang Yuying sings a song very similar"}
{"translation": "If I answer the question in the same way, I think classmate An will definitely cry and faint in the toilet when going out."}
{"translation": "So this is the typical answer"}
{"translation": "In my opinion what is beauty"}
{"translation": "What is aesthetics"}
{"translation": "Beauty is hard"}
{"translation": "As for what you think, I can&#39;t do it anyway"}
{"translation": "Why"}
{"translation": "Because it&#39;s not scientific"}
{"translation": "Why not scientific"}
{"translation": "It&#39;s not our habit to ask nonsense"}
{"translation": "The bottom line is the emperor of the scientist, we have to answer this question"}
{"translation": "So how do I think about this problem"}
{"translation": "Luo thought about it for almost 30 years"}
{"translation": "I want to use natural science methods to study aesthetics"}
{"translation": "We have a famous physicist, Mr. Peng Huanwu. He said that although the material world is ever-changing, it is very sincere. Under the same conditions, the same phenomenon will inevitably occur."}
{"translation": "Then I put Mr. Peng\u2019s words on aesthetic research"}
{"translation": "What I want to say is that although the world of beauty is ever-changing, although there are various beauties present here are very different, there should be inherent laws."}
{"translation": "So if I do it concretely, then I will first start with the question from the left hand"}
{"translation": "Teacher Istan taught us that it\u2019s not surprising that Yunsan taught us general relativity and also taught us scientific research methods."}
{"translation": "He said that raising a good problem is more important than solving a problem"}
{"translation": "What is beauty"}
{"translation": "I think this question can be rephrased"}
{"translation": "My formulation means that Netease\u2019s aesthetic objects can include everyone, including beauty, back, including food, my art, and the beauty of the water can include the science of beauty. What standards do they meet?"}
{"translation": "In other words, what is the criterion for judging beauty in a broad sense?"}
{"translation": "I transformed this question"}
{"translation": "In other words, we can understand what is beautiful and what is beautiful when the criterion for judging beauty in a broad sense is determined."}
{"translation": "Of course, Netease Beauty\u2019s standard of judgment is a little bit more. I call it the general rule of every rule, so I want to establish a general rule of beauty."}
{"translation": "So what about the specific approach?"}
{"translation": "I am a three-stage method that respects the comparative standards of our natural science research"}
{"translation": "If the money is not in the middle, then we specifically say we are a three-stage method"}
{"translation": "First of all, we have to summarize"}
{"translation": "We need to take out all the different types of beauty according to us"}
{"translation": "Then we have to regain"}
{"translation": "In other words, the crew should try their best to exhaustively list whether they have anything that we think beautiful violates our laws."}
{"translation": "If it\u2019s violated, we have to modify the house"}
{"translation": "Then we have to falsify"}
{"translation": "We have to find things that don\u2019t conform to this rule."}
{"translation": "In this case, then I finally got the broad law"}
{"translation": "The way to generalized beauty is beauty. One defect is not common"}
{"translation": "We will feel beautiful if we meet these two conditions"}
{"translation": "No money is pure values"}
{"translation": "For example, it is powerful, for example, it is natural, reasonable, complete, and silly"}
{"translation": "It is common for the Chang&#39;an Ministry to refer to Bitcoin that is not as good as the sun."}
{"translation": "The man here is you. If you post any of the common items in my list to your girlfriend or your wife, I promise that he will not kill you and you will be stuck."}
{"translation": "So the judgment of beauty or not lies in this place"}
{"translation": "What is aesthetics"}
{"translation": "Why do we have different aesthetics"}
{"translation": "Cun Liguan is to judge the ability and values of beauty to judge whether there is a defect, and then our insight to judge whether it is uncommon"}
{"translation": "Therefore, different values and our different insights have led to our different aesthetics."}
{"translation": "The same thing is indifferent, whoever thinks that there is no defect and is not common, whoever thinks it is beautiful"}
{"translation": "When do you feel that it is not common to have no money, when do you feel that there is no money"}
{"translation": "When did you find it common? You don\u2019t feel tired if you think it\u2019s normal"}
{"translation": "Therefore, there is no appreciable beauty, no absolute beauty, no universal beauty, and no eternal beauty."}
{"translation": "Not always changing"}
{"translation": "Let me give you an example"}
{"translation": "This is a lamp I made in my circle of friends yesterday"}
{"translation": "We know that the weather in Beijing was very good a few days ago"}
{"translation": "Everyone is in the blue sky and white clouds in their circle of friends one after another"}
{"translation": "I wrote about the morning glow and white clouds yesterday"}
{"translation": "I said Zhou Xiang still sings blue sky or floating dolomite why no one said to buy it today"}
{"translation": "Because the blue sky and white clouds have been around for a while, although there is still no time, it is not common anymore, so everyone doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s sold."}
{"translation": "Tell me gently in the smog when will you end your vacation"}
{"translation": "Asked such a question"}
{"translation": "Then there is a bottle because my friend said that if a scientific professional sees this, he must be elevated. Then the scientist will sacrifice everyone\u2019s health in order to verify each of his theories."}
{"translation": "I quickly answered that this is not the case with me"}
{"translation": "I replied that I said my ass, hello, stayed in a panic, I would rather have a common blue sky than a healthy curve"}
{"translation": "Then another friend went on to comment that this comment is more sensible"}
{"translation": "He said that he hadn&#39;t seen the weather for a few days, but he was dissatisfied and missed the weather today."}
{"translation": "Said that making friends carelessly is the consequence"}
{"translation": "for example"}
{"translation": "This example is Mr. He Ze he is my mentor"}
{"translation": "I didn\u2019t tell me the autumn colors of Tsinghua Park, but they were all beautiful"}
{"translation": "This is what I posted in my circle of friends on November 22"}
{"translation": "Two things happened on November 22nd"}
{"translation": "One thing is that a commemorative meeting was held at Tsinghua University to commemorate the 69th anniversary of the publication of important research results of my supervisor and Mr."}
{"translation": "Heyanzhong passed away a few years ago"}
{"translation": "Let\u2019s take a look at the little girl on the left in this photo, this little beauty"}
{"translation": "Photo of Mr. Tray when he was young"}
{"translation": "Obviously a little beauty"}
{"translation": "On the right is a photo of my mentor and husband in their later years"}
{"translation": "Still radiant"}
{"translation": "That\u2019s why I said Mr. He\u2019s high IQ, high face value and high moral character"}
{"translation": "Such a beauty is the ultimate beauty"}
{"translation": "Similarly, the beautiful scenery of autumn in Tsinghua Park. Are autumn colors good and not flawed because of the harvest season?"}
{"translation": "When you see autumn scenery, you usually have a better natural environment"}
{"translation": "The snow scene is also good. The first snow of the year is also good for a good year."}
{"translation": "There was a heavy snowfall in Beijing on November 20th"}
{"translation": "But of course these two things together are still flawless"}
{"translation": "More importantly, it is not common"}
{"translation": "Seeking truth and learning scenery together is not common"}
{"translation": "The school is early, crossed out, can\u2019t stay to study, the school is late, the autumn colors are gone"}
{"translation": "The autumn scenery and snow scenery are the most beautiful together"}
{"translation": "Because it is an extreme that is not common in aesthetics"}
{"translation": "So on November 20th, everyone was online and in the circle of friends. Photos every day"}
{"translation": "The reason is this"}
{"translation": "And the beauty with three highs is also extremely rare, so it is the ultimate beauty"}
{"translation": "Let me give an example to show that it is the most beautiful without defects and uncommon"}
{"translation": "Let\u2019s talk about the beauty of science"}
{"translation": "I talked about the science of beauty and made it clear"}
{"translation": "Talk about the beauty of science"}
{"translation": "We know that scientific exploration is full of surprises"}
{"translation": "The accident is of course the biggest uncommon"}
{"translation": "I do astronomy research by myself"}
{"translation": "I use astronomy as an example"}
{"translation": "We know that most of the groundbreaking astronomy research is produced outside"}
{"translation": "I counted"}
{"translation": "There are about a dozen Nobel Prizes in Physics won by the Institute of Science and Technology, and only one of them has achieved results according to the plan."}
{"translation": "When it rains, I will only talk about one of them. Although I have listed so many, I will only talk about one."}
{"translation": "This is also related to beautiful women"}
{"translation": "This is how Ms. Bell discovered the sales center for 10 years in 1967"}
{"translation": "I want to see this little beauty, he is a photo from his research, a photo familiar to a graduate student"}
{"translation": "What he had to do at that time was to study the phenomenon of interstellar flicker."}
{"translation": "I accidentally discovered the time signal for the periodic arrival of shopping here"}
{"translation": "The picture on the far right is from a meeting in Hawaii last summer this summer when I met Professor Bell"}
{"translation": "I also realized before"}
{"translation": "We chatted together"}
{"translation": "We see that what Bell wants is still brilliance"}
{"translation": "Yes, this is also a three-high beauty with good looks, high IQ and high morals"}
{"translation": "Three beauties moving together are my goddess"}
{"translation": "Let\u2019s show you some pictures that represent the beauty you think."}
{"translation": "The photo on the far left is a photo of a creature and a photo of Panjin steamed buns breaking out"}
{"translation": "And the middle one is a photo of our fingers hurting and a soap bubble"}
{"translation": "Is a picture of a galaxy on the right"}
{"translation": "These photos are beautiful and undesirable photos"}
{"translation": "Why beautiful"}
{"translation": "The phenomenon is natural, so it doesn\u2019t appear to be invisible to the naked eye, so it\u2019s not common"}
{"translation": "He happens often but our eyes don\u2019t see it, so after we saw it, we said it was a beautiful and undesirable photo"}
{"translation": "Explain the problem again"}
{"translation": "The same goes for scientific photos"}
{"translation": "Let\u2019s talk about Anstein\u2019s general theory of relativity"}
{"translation": "We know that I just talked about the most beautiful scientific theory of general relativity published by Einstein on November 25th 100 years ago."}
{"translation": "The general theory of relativity is of course based on Newton\u2019s mechanics. We know that it was published in 1916 and 87."}
{"translation": "This theory looks very simple to us this year"}
{"translation": "He promoted Galileo\u2019s principle of inertia to Newton\u2019s first and second laws and added Newton\u2019s third law. This is Newton\u2019s original and the law of universal gravitation is also Newton\u2019s original."}
{"translation": "Then we can calculate Kepler&#39;s three laws"}
{"translation": "So this is the substantive content of his theory"}
{"translation": "Where is his lack of authority?"}
{"translation": "He explained all the known observations and experimental phenomena at the time"}
{"translation": "Of course it is a complete beauty school"}
{"translation": "The unusual reaction here is a quantitative and scientific theory in human history."}
{"translation": "His correct language and the existence of Neptune, the positive language is the language, which was discovered after observation"}
{"translation": "It was the discovery of Neptune that thoroughly established the correctness of Newtonian mechanics as the first natural science theory."}
{"translation": "So from the point of view at the time, Newton\u2019s theory of mechanics was already very beautiful. It was an uncommon mechanism for every defect at that time."}
{"translation": "But some people don\u2019t think that this is Einstein"}
{"translation": "Einstein believed that Newton\u2019s theory of gravity is flawed. The reaction is in two ways."}
{"translation": "The theory is flawed"}
{"translation": "Einstein believed that the instantaneous effect in Newton&#39;s theory is anti-special relativity"}
{"translation": "So what is the nature of gravity?"}
{"translation": "Useful learning"}
{"translation": "Einstein deeply investigated the abnormal path of Mercury&#39;s perihelion"}
{"translation": "He thinks this cannot be explained by Newton\u2019s theory of gravity"}
{"translation": "So he asked about the scope of Newton\u2019s theory of gravity."}
{"translation": "This is two very big flaws for Einstein"}
{"translation": "Therefore, Einstein proposed the general theory of relativity, of course, to make up for the defects of Newton&#39;s theory."}
{"translation": "The theoretical aesthetic line is embodied in the essence of gravity is that mass causes the curvature of time and space."}
{"translation": "The curved space-time determines the movement of all matter, including the movement of light."}
{"translation": "The practical enzyme defect is reflected in the fact that it is more accurate under the weak gravitational field, which is similar to Newton\u2019s theory under the strong gravitational field."}
{"translation": "Therefore, all the phenomena that Newton&#39;s theory can explain can be explained by generalized equality."}
{"translation": "Phenomenon that Newton\u2019s theory cannot explain or where errors cannot be ignored. Generalized understanding can be used."}
{"translation": "Therefore, the general theory of physiognomy was not flawed when it was put forward by Laiyang."}
{"translation": "Then this theory also needs to be uncommon in order to meet the aesthetic management rules that are uncommon in aesthetics."}
{"translation": "Another flawless example. I just talked about his theory. The above is the essence of gravity. The above is used to make up for the calculation inaccuracy of Newton&#39;s theory."}
{"translation": "The most important point is the abnormal precession of Mercury&#39;s perihelion"}
{"translation": "This is completely incomprehensible in Newton&#39;s theory"}
{"translation": "In the general theory of relativity, I will list this place for everyone. We can see that the accurate calculations have come to this result."}
{"translation": "To make up for a major flaw in Newton&#39;s theory"}
{"translation": "It is not common in the broad sense that it is reflected in his first person who has established a deep connection between antimatter and time and space."}
{"translation": "I just said that Newton&#39;s theory was the first quantitative and systematic scientific theory at the time, and the theory of general relativity was the first theory that established a profound connection between matter and space-time. It was the first to reveal that the material world&#39;s space-time is essentially curved. Theory of"}
{"translation": "It used to be straight and now it is curved"}
{"translation": "Moreover, this theory successfully predicted new types of celestial bodies and a series of new phenomena, including black holes, expansion of the universe, gravitational sky, no red gravitational waves, and a series of languages."}
{"translation": "In the end, most of the political theories were observed"}
{"translation": "There is still a small amount of hemp waiting to be confirmed"}
{"translation": "Give everyone a simple example"}
{"translation": "This is where the gravitational filmmakers have verified the predictions of general relativity"}
{"translation": "The general theory of relativity predicts that when the rays of distant celestial bodies pass near the sun, they must be naturally selected by the rays of the sun\u2019s gravitational field."}
{"translation": "Then it takes time to turn off the certificate"}
{"translation": "It was this observation that thoroughly established the superiority of the theory of general relativity over Newton&#39;s theory and made the theory of general relativity widely accepted at that time."}
{"translation": "Are there any flaws in the theory of general relativity today?"}
{"translation": "If I say that it is the most beautiful scientific theory, of course we need to discuss whether it is flawed or not"}
{"translation": "In terms of practicality, you can say, oh, don\u2019t understand you."}
{"translation": "It&#39;s not Einstein&#39;s wrong or right"}
{"translation": "It&#39;s not sensible, you didn&#39;t learn"}
{"translation": "Are there any flaws in theory"}
{"translation": "We know that there are some problems that are not in harmony with quantum theory"}
{"translation": "In the future, of course, we expect Professor Fat to solve this problem"}
{"translation": "But we don\u2019t know if quantum theory is wrong or general relativity is wrong."}
{"translation": "A few questions. Enstein doesn\u2019t believe in the black holes predicted by his own theory, but he thinks that nature might be able to avoid mentioning some points."}
{"translation": "Contemporary quantum physicists believe that quantum theory may be able to circumvent the 7-point problem"}
{"translation": "None of these efforts have been successful today"}
{"translation": "I have done research on 7 o\u2019clock myself"}
{"translation": "The results of my research show that there is actually no difference inside a black hole"}
{"translation": "But it doesn\u2019t need new laws of nature"}
{"translation": "Just need to understand and apply general relativity"}
{"translation": "This is a few years ago when I traveled back to the teacher Anslan, I would give this result"}
{"translation": "Really no flaws"}
{"translation": "So Einstein\u2019s theory is still an uncommon and flawless machine in our opinion today."}
{"translation": "We are still looking forward to more general relativity predictions not long"}
{"translation": "For example, gravitational waves"}
{"translation": "Now the rumor in the scientific community may be true, so gravitational waves have been detected."}
{"translation": "If so, it must be a Nobel Prize"}
{"translation": "Of course, we are expecting that the uncommonness of this generalized language will bring us many surprises."}
{"translation": "Finally, let me talk about the driving force of social development and the nature of scientific and technological innovation."}
{"translation": "Let&#39;s use this aesthetic theory to explain"}
{"translation": "There is no universal beauty but diversity"}
{"translation": "I have just said that there is vitality only when there is variety and beauty"}
{"translation": "There is no most beautiful, only more beautiful"}
{"translation": "The pursuit of more beauty is therefore the driving force for social development"}
{"translation": "Technological innovation, we all know that the purpose of doing homework is to make up for defects, while the purpose of scientific innovation is to discover the uncommon"}
{"translation": "Therefore, my conclusion is that the driving force of social development and the essence of high-tech innovation is the pursuit of beauty."}
{"translation": "That&#39;s it for my report"}
{"translation": ""}
