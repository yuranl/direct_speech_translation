{"translation": "good afternoon everyone"}
{"translation": "Our current Internet technology is quite developed"}
{"translation": "Through WeChat, we can easily send a joke to our relatives and friends, send a picture, send a video"}
{"translation": "Even if we use 10 of his institutions in one minute,"}
{"translation": "But there are also things that are difficult to post"}
{"translation": "For example, if you send $10 to a friend who comes to the U.S., it will be difficult for you to try it."}
{"translation": "This is because assets like the dollar bill shop cannot be copied, and their peer-to-peer delivery requires trust."}
{"translation": "Trust how we solve it in real life"}
{"translation": "In actual life, we often rely on intermediary agencies such as government banks"}
{"translation": "There is such an important intermediary organization, they constitute the credit foundation of our society"}
{"translation": "Many times their work is very good"}
{"translation": "So we call them a universal intermediary"}
{"translation": "But there seem to be many problems in life"}
{"translation": "The cross-border remittance that Liu just mentioned"}
{"translation": "He is not only efficient and low-cost, but also very high"}
{"translation": "Today we buy a house. Tomorrow a lot of big brothers and sisters will care about how to decorate your house."}
{"translation": "Obviously leaked"}
{"translation": "At the best time, I didn\u2019t say that this is the middle of all evil"}
{"translation": "Is it possible for us to use technology to optimize the body is to reconstruct the trust foundation of this society?"}
{"translation": "In 2008, a hacker named Satoshi Nakamoto released a peer-to-peer electronic payment system"}
{"translation": "After the system went online, it has been favored by many hacker organizations, money laundering organizations, and other gray organizations."}
{"translation": "This system is the Bitcoin system"}
{"translation": "Bitcoin has also risen 3 million times in this eight years"}
{"translation": "Of course there is a lot of speculation in it"}
{"translation": "But it is undeniable that Bitcoin has its core price"}
{"translation": "Let\u2019s take a look at the difference between Bitcoin transfer and bank transfer."}
{"translation": "The bank transfer on the left is familiar to all of us"}
{"translation": "It relies on the bank as an intermediary institution to maintain credit"}
{"translation": "Simultaneous device relies on the bank to help him keep accounts"}
{"translation": "It\u2019s easier to add one to the downloaded account minus one from the account"}
{"translation": "This bitcoin transfer on the right"}
{"translation": "It looks more complicated, let me give you a brief introduction"}
{"translation": "Compared to when making a bitcoin transfer"}
{"translation": "This transaction Bitcoin system uses P2P network technology to transmit to all Bitcoin network nodes"}
{"translation": "All network nodes will use a common algorithm to verify whether the transaction is valid"}
{"translation": "At the same time, the verification result is transmitted to all other nodes through P2P network technology."}
{"translation": "I want everyone to book together based on the results of this verification"}
{"translation": "It is based on the algorithm to reach a consensus to generate credit"}
{"translation": "It relies on the network to keep accounts"}
{"translation": "Every node on the network keeps accounts together"}
{"translation": "The biggest difference"}
{"translation": "You will find that there is no need for intermediary agencies anymore"}
{"translation": "This is why many financial institutions will study this technology in the past two years because this technology may bring about a disruptive effect."}
{"translation": "This technology is what we are talking about blockchain technology"}
{"translation": "It mainly contains five categories of technology"}
{"translation": "The P2P network technology mentioned just now also has consensus algorithm technology, peptide chain structure technology, and smart and smoke password shoes."}
{"translation": "These five technologies are not actually new technologies. They existed many years ago."}
{"translation": "But they combine to form a magical chemical reaction that can create trust"}
{"translation": "This is like the magical iPhone created by Jobs 10 years ago by adding a mobile phone, an iPad, and a browser."}
{"translation": "We have been working as a third-party payment system for so many years"}
{"translation": "We combine more than ten years of technology accumulation with the technical concepts of blockchain and the characteristics of the information systems of many enterprises in our reality to re-innovate a new set of blockchain systems."}
{"translation": "A database-based blockchain system we call it trust co"}
{"translation": "We think that the chess block chain technology belongs to the basic connection technology at the bottom of the foundation."}
{"translation": "We mentioned a lot of intermediary issues. If we combine the reliable technical capabilities of the blockchain technology"}
{"translation": "1G develops practical application solutions for specific problems"}
{"translation": "In the future, we will use these basic application solutions to optimize and even solve the problem of mutual trust between our institutions and even enterprises."}
{"translation": "Then it will make the collaboration between our institutions more credible, more efficient, and cheaper"}
{"translation": "So as to achieve true value maximization"}
{"translation": "So how do we use this technology?"}
{"translation": "Before we mentioned the blockchain, many people thought of Bitcoin and even some people thought it was Jin Yong"}
{"translation": "Today we are talking about something different"}
{"translation": "Like our relatives are lost"}
{"translation": "Can we find him faster"}
{"translation": "We all know that there are many public welfare administrative agencies"}
{"translation": "But we don\u2019t know that this is the data security issue of the information entered by the agency because of the verification of the information, the issue of data attribution, and the issue of privacy protection, etc."}
{"translation": "Cause these institutions are actually not so revived"}
{"translation": "This makes their rooted institution actually a highly encouraged information island"}
{"translation": "What&#39;s the problem"}
{"translation": "one example"}
{"translation": "When our child is lost"}
{"translation": "When routing information from the first node to the second node, there is confidence. This usually takes several hours."}
{"translation": "In the process"}
{"translation": "It is possible that the child is walking through the broadcast of the second node 71"}
{"translation": "I might have found it and went home for dinner."}
{"translation": "But in fact, they don\u2019t know this information"}
{"translation": "He is still looking for people everywhere, causing a lot of waste of resources"}
{"translation": "April of this year"}
{"translation": "We have a 404 when our baby goes home"}
{"translation": "Using xcode&#39;s shared ledger solution to create a charity tracing exercise"}
{"translation": "He can do 1.6 into the front chain universal"}
{"translation": "Can effectively avoid the question of information islands"}
{"translation": "Make newcomers more efficient and more efficient and transparent"}
{"translation": "Mail is best to happen to me"}
{"translation": "Half a month ago"}
{"translation": "One of my high school classmates"}
{"translation": "I was anxious to find me and said their old man was lost"}
{"translation": "The toy that day was the afternoon of August 14th"}
{"translation": "That night, we helped him complete the verification of the information and entered it"}
{"translation": "Noon on the 2nd day"}
{"translation": "My classmate told me very happily"}
{"translation": "The old man in his family found it back and he didn&#39;t expect that he could find it back so soon"}
{"translation": "At that time, we actually didn\u2019t expect to be able to get it back so quickly"}
{"translation": "We go and 10 when"}
{"translation": "I found that the old man was retrieved through the WeChat Moments advertisement"}
{"translation": "In other words, when we finished entering the information that night, we went home from the baby 66"}
{"translation": "In the future, this information was immediately obtained from the information node of WeChat and broadcasted using WeChat Moments advertisements."}
{"translation": "Someone saw this ad and found this old man"}
{"translation": "So we got the old man back in a very fast time"}
{"translation": "Although this is a case of a small pedestrian, we also deeply found that it embodies the charm of blockchain technology."}
{"translation": "He can actually make the value of our society become more shallow and warm"}
{"translation": "This is a small case"}
{"translation": "Actually we can think of something bigger"}
{"translation": "There is a very famous social topic about how to prove that your mother is your mother."}
{"translation": "Said he answered the sensation"}
{"translation": "At that time, I said that when we did other things, we thought of the fact that we were born to grow old."}
{"translation": "We have been facing this problem. We are proving our existence, proving our growth, proving our ability."}
{"translation": "why"}
{"translation": "Because we have been applying for the certificate, the student ID, the birth certificate and then the real estate certificate"}
{"translation": "At the same time, in the process of applying for the certificate, we also found that we spent a lot of time and a lot of money and a lot of trouble."}
{"translation": "If we can use the application solution of the blockchain to witness the certificate, we can load the data behind the certificate on a digital identity chain to achieve true alignment."}
{"translation": "In the future, we only need a fingerprint to authorize the dispatch of this data to make our own personal proof."}
{"translation": "Is it true that in the future society, he won\u2019t reappear the question of how to prove that your mother is your mother\u2019s egg?"}
{"translation": "In addition, I don\u2019t know if you have ever thought about what will happen to him if we really have no cash for the society"}
{"translation": "In the first half of the year, a TV series was very popular in the name of the people"}
{"translation": "There is a taste in it, the director was arrested as soon as he opened, and he was 100 million yuan"}
{"translation": "When I saw this place, I was thinking"}
{"translation": "if"}
{"translation": "We can digitize various farmland assets such as cash for the society, and it can be placed in the blockchain"}
{"translation": "Using the non-tamperable and traceable ability of the blockchain, can our millennia of anti-corruption problem be effectively controlled?"}
{"translation": "Just now we talked about a few cases, that means there are three ideas"}
{"translation": "We will find that our future world has another possibility because of the blockchain"}
{"translation": "Just like the blockchain technology used by bacteria optimizes the credit foundation of our society"}
{"translation": "It\u2019s like we used wood and stone to build a house before"}
{"translation": "We are now building the house with reinforced concrete"}
{"translation": "Blockchain technology is what we need to find reinforced concrete"}
{"translation": "It can make our future relationships between people and institutions and institutions and even between countries and countries become more harmonious. Old stories can make their collaboration more efficient and transparent, and create greater value for society."}
{"translation": "As long as we dare to break through our thinking, dare to try, we have a politically warm heart in our hearts"}
{"translation": "Then we can also use this technology to emit a dazzling light"}
{"translation": "thank you all"}
