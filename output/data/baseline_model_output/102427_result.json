{"translation": "good afternoon everyone"}
{"translation": "I am Zhang Wuxiong from Shanghai Institute of Microsystems, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}
{"translation": "Can you help me introduce to you in this report today, what we represent through the Internet is how China Information Technology handles the safety of this project."}
{"translation": "I want to look at it from several aspects"}
{"translation": "We all hate this tofu project, but the current stage of the tofu project is still inevitable"}
{"translation": "We can look back at our 2007 Jiujiang Bridge collapsed instantly because of this spreading impact."}
{"translation": "This was a very important world at the time"}
{"translation": "There are a lot of tofu dregs projects that can run on the highway"}
{"translation": "We can see a flat one on the Internet is this high-speed highway in Tianjin, Gansu."}
{"translation": "Soon after the opening to traffic in 2011, although the cost of his building was as high as one month per kilometer"}
{"translation": "But a few days after it was built, the highway was cracked and then it was immediately unusable and entered a maintenance period."}
{"translation": "We can also see a world in Shanghai"}
{"translation": "We had a similar world on the lotus river at the time"}
{"translation": "But because of the land, the buildings collapsed instantly"}
{"translation": "Of course, the prices of the second-hand houses of his and his second-hand houses are not too low."}
{"translation": "I thought it was later discovered that this building\u2019s knowledge structure for Polya was quite good"}
{"translation": "It\u2019s just that he didn\u2019t do a good job of this foundation, but it can\u2019t be denied that he did cut corners at the time."}
{"translation": "In fact, as the Internet of Things"}
{"translation": "He can know his overall understanding of maintenance from the source of this building from the very beginning to its operation."}
{"translation": "When we can first look at what is the Internet of Things"}
{"translation": "The term &quot;Internet&quot; refers to the architecture diagram we provided to Premier Wen when he visited and inspected the Wuxi branch during our experiment in 2009."}
{"translation": "But the Internet of Things is adjusted in the temperature"}
{"translation": "Now we all know the word Internet of Things"}
{"translation": "So since the term Internet may be strange to everyone in life, we can see that there are actually many things in life that are already the Internet."}
{"translation": "I will take a look at the diagonal bikes of Mobike ofo. These are some of the better applications of the Internet of Things."}
{"translation": "Now the applications with a large area on the Internet are smart driving or using cars"}
{"translation": "Each car has a network composed of hundreds of these different sensors to monitor the quality of the car and detect the running status of the car."}
{"translation": "So the following is the kind of joint efforts that Shanghai is currently implementing"}
{"translation": "Grow telephone poles, street light poles, etc. directly into a system"}
{"translation": "We can make a charging pile for him below, then we can make WiFi for him, and then we can basically do some environmental monitoring for him."}
{"translation": "This is a very good application to the Internet"}
{"translation": "When I can give a review of a few early IoT applications, I will start from the right."}
{"translation": "This is the blue algae monitoring we sat in Taihu Lake in 2019, but the water quality in the Taihu Lake basin is also very bad."}
{"translation": "Then the system behind Bo\u2019s darkroom is also a large single IoT system at the time."}
{"translation": "We can see the left"}
{"translation": "This is the Internet of Things system we used for this ordinary airport"}
{"translation": "From 2006 to now, it is still working normally for more than ten years"}
{"translation": "For comparison, we have transferred a few people who are going to destroy but he hasn&#39;t done it yet"}
{"translation": "The main reason is that we have the system of the Internet of Things to perform some early monitoring of it, which can prevent these saboteurs from coming earlier than before."}
{"translation": "So back to today\u2019s topic is like what happened in the Internet of Things, pay attention to the safety of buildings"}
{"translation": "This is our first look at the safety of the construction of the building"}
{"translation": "What can the Internet do"}
{"translation": "This is how many of us in the palace are very heavy"}
{"translation": "How can a person in a historical building ensure that the right person is that a qualified person is doing what he can do in the river?"}
{"translation": "On the other hand, we have to ensure that his materials, including his craftsmanship, and his safeguards are up to standard."}
{"translation": "We can see if there are some such IoT systems in the first construction site here. We can monitor in real time whether the managers are doing it."}
{"translation": "It has an electrician"}
{"translation": "Is he really an electrician operating some live equipment?"}
{"translation": "Does the operator of this tower crane also have the corresponding certificate?"}
{"translation": "Correspondingly, there are some technologies that can be affectionate with those systems and will do some positioning"}
{"translation": "So are the building materials qualified?"}
{"translation": "We can also enter each material from the early stage. I will monitor it and place it in the designated location after the inspection."}
{"translation": "When someone re-spots these building materials, the system can maintain a traceability in the entire process from his storage to delivery to use."}
{"translation": "Just like we do food traceability"}
{"translation": "Then the third person is that we have to ensure that the construction process is up to standard"}
{"translation": "We will have some Internet methods and long-term methods, including some of our video monitoring methods, to detect whether it is up to standard"}
{"translation": "In addition, we can see whether this safeguard measure is the guarantee for our scaffolding to be stable and reliable."}
{"translation": "In this case, we will also make some sensors on it to monitor its quality"}
{"translation": "So in this case, we have made a complete set of this solution or system based on the Internet of Things"}
{"translation": "We can see that there are 10 kinds of sensors underneath"}
{"translation": "We can manage the personnel, manage this tower crane, and manage this dog and duck, including the fitness fund."}
{"translation": "We also manage the environment, including the exhaust, drainage, etc., including videos, as well as the in and out of vehicles, including his circle, and some automatic detection."}
{"translation": "With these sensors, we control all the conditions of the entire construction site through information means"}
{"translation": "Find a system of various applications of this kind that we will build afterwards to perform security monitoring and analysis on it"}
{"translation": "for example"}
{"translation": "First of all, the one on the left is when we have some safety accidents, I want to make sure where my personnel are, where are my equipment, and where are my rescue measures."}
{"translation": "Truth also has a system to monitor"}
{"translation": "The safety of the tower crane is also a very important"}
{"translation": "We will have some sensors on this crane to detect whether it is tilted or not due to swing, etc."}
{"translation": "Then the environmental construction and light color are the very strict requirements currently required by the government."}
{"translation": "We can keep the water in the atmosphere polluted, so this is a very important part of the Internet of Things to solve this problem."}
{"translation": "Regarding the glass curtain wall, this is a big issue we are considering"}
{"translation": "In our country, this glass curtain wall has been a large area of information since the 1980s."}
{"translation": "The tall buildings in our city are also very dense"}
{"translation": "Our entire glass curtain wall occupancy rate has reached a very high amount of 85% of the world"}
{"translation": "But the glass curtain wall also has its problem"}
{"translation": "Although it currently has many advantages compared to the United States, its construction is also relatively simple"}
{"translation": "But the life span of glass is only 15 years"}
{"translation": "The most commonly used structural glue for chemical glass has been taught for about 10 years"}
{"translation": "So whether it is broken glass or a structural teacher school will have a great impact on him"}
{"translation": "So in the field of glass curtain wall monitoring"}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, because the world\u2019s largest glass curtain wall uses Fruit China, his research in this field abroad is actually not so advanced."}
{"translation": "Only now the traditional detection may be the most possible. We have some detection equipment backed by a piece of glass to explore"}
{"translation": "Then there is no detection method is to use this kind of rubber mallet to hit his glass, so it is relatively primitive and backward"}
{"translation": "At the same time, the life span of some of our building materials is mainly live broadcast"}
{"translation": "Including structural exchange, including some of the structures inside, the construction life is relatively short, unlike our surface concrete structure"}
{"translation": "The third reason is that this external factor has a relatively large influence"}
{"translation": "Typhoons have a great impact on bridges, and typhoons have the same effect on glass."}
{"translation": "Constantly to shock"}
{"translation": "At the same time, our glass is cleaned every year"}
{"translation": "Then when the external wall is plugged in, the tower crane is hoisted down"}
{"translation": "Then when the wind blows, he swings the motion back to it for many years, so it brings a lot of safety problems."}
{"translation": "In our early days, the Shanghai Center had similar things in the past few years."}
{"translation": "After the whole glass fell"}
{"translation": "Fortunately, he hit the car and didn&#39;t hit anyone"}
{"translation": "Think about how long will it take to fall an egg can kill a person, let alone a glass"}
{"translation": "Although we have used the technology and means of the Internet of Things to solve this problem, we have built a glass curtain wall safety monitoring system. This is to explain some cooperation with those schools in the same home."}
{"translation": "I think we have the sensor in the previous section that can detect his vibration. 10 Don\u2019t include the temperature, etc., which affect the safety of the glass."}
{"translation": "Then there are some transmission technologies of this narrowband Internet of Things that can easily collect some status data of the front-end glass."}
{"translation": "Then after he comes up, we can use this platform and there will be some big data cloud computing methods in the future."}
{"translation": "Including the combination with the more fashionable artificial intelligence now"}
{"translation": "We conducted a lot of this data collection and analysis"}
{"translation": "It can tell in advance to build a model that the glass curtain wall will break"}
{"translation": "In this case, we can know how much the risk is"}
{"translation": "The second question is which day can we get to the glass curtain wall"}
{"translation": "In fact, according to our current safety standards, the glass still has a certain degree of authority, but I believe that it will be simpler in the future after using our system."}
{"translation": "Back to the third question, how do we solve the Internet of Things is to continue in the process of operation"}
{"translation": "The picture on the left shows our Jin Mao Tower"}
{"translation": "We think of the high-rise buildings that the safety of this building may first think of"}
{"translation": "In fact, the place where I am very dangerous now is these Xiaowei places including this kind of group rental housing"}
{"translation": "There are also more people living in the writing workshop, including this kind of hydraulic computer, which is also a very big fire hazard."}
{"translation": "Just like our current theater, if there is a fire next to it, people may have already withdrawn, but we don\u2019t even know if the next door is on fire."}
{"translation": "We may be very late when we arrive later"}
{"translation": "Are there any methods and measures that can solve or give us some hints?"}
{"translation": "There is"}
{"translation": "So during our operation, we thought of a lot of methods and then made a lot of CEOs of Internet of People for a lot of different applications."}
{"translation": "Well, this is now a relatively hot way to teach this independent strict"}
{"translation": "The traditional smoke rod may be linked to the sprinkler facility by the fire department."}
{"translation": "Any building must have this set of equipment if it is to be accepted"}
{"translation": "Now there are some independent smoke feelings, so we can integrate this kind of technology including the hotter narrowband Internet of Things nb-iot including Laura and so on."}
{"translation": "Because there are two transmission technologies for these bombs, it can have a life span of more than 10 years, so we can integrate some of this kind of voice broadcast information on it after we leave it in the room."}
{"translation": "If there is a fire next door, we may know it in this room instantly."}
{"translation": "Well, with the support of the Shanghai Economic and Information Commission and the Science and Technology Commission"}
{"translation": "We care about this Yangpu and Hongkou from this Oriental Pearl, and now there are nearly 30,000 in this free-standing smoke"}
{"translation": "So if you are interested in every family in the future, you can also buy this kind of equipment and install one."}
{"translation": "You can use the App to see if there is such a fire or hidden danger in your home"}
{"translation": "What is the safety of the elevator is also a big problem now"}
{"translation": "Shanghai is actually a place where elevators are widely used"}
{"translation": "The number of 300,000 elevators in our house has been in service for more than 15 years, and there may be thousands of hits."}
{"translation": "Then there are seven to eighty thousand units from 10 to 15 years old, so this is also a big raw material"}
{"translation": "The specific actual service life is generally referred to as a broken relationship according to the requirements, so how to do this maintenance is also a big problem."}
{"translation": "Although we have not had so many accidents, the Internet of Things can certainly do a lot for the safety of this electrical appliance."}
{"translation": "In the future, we will now install a lot of sensors in the elevator, including the floor, including the Heisei, including the smoke pole, including the OK room, which can control the current of the main wire of the elevator, and so on, including its temperature to determine whether the elevator is not. Safety"}
{"translation": "After we can do this, we can collect a lot of status data of the elevator, so we can do a lot of artificial intelligence analysis remotely."}
{"translation": "After the analysis, one thing I can actually do is the rationalized Weibo of the elevator"}
{"translation": "Now that the elevator is normally maintained, someone may go to the bank for maintenance on paper materials."}
{"translation": "Did he go"}
{"translation": "How about it"}
{"translation": "No one knows"}
{"translation": "After getting the interesting Internet of Things system in the future, we can effectively guarantee the safety of each elevator"}
{"translation": "Well, this is actually not my major"}
{"translation": "That is, we will write an envelope in this building, including some water supply, including some faculty diagrams that stimulate water"}
{"translation": "Then there are some technical means with the Internet of Things"}
{"translation": "We can measure the outlet of the fresh air through the sensor and take a look at the wind to see the quality of the air in this room. What is its temperature and humidity? Then adjust the most suitable temperature and humidity."}
{"translation": "Can you shampoo? You can see if the flow rate of the water is in the same formula and if there is some pollution in it, etc."}
{"translation": "In this way, the safety of the building can be guaranteed"}
{"translation": "This was done by our partner on that Guangzhou Xiaoman waist"}
{"translation": "For the tall building of the sales building, we can also look at the swing of the tall building after we have some sensors on it. Look at his vibrations, then we can judge whether it is in a safe state."}
{"translation": "I think this is also me. I think this kind of thing will be used in high-rise buildings like Shanghai Center in the future."}
{"translation": "Then the other one is my job in 78 years"}
{"translation": "At that time, we did this safety protection for the middle route of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project."}
{"translation": "Then the middle line is from the Danjiangkou Reservoir, which is at the junction of North Henan, which diverts 1432 kilometers of water to Beijing and Tianjin, with 11 cubic meters of water per year in Beijing and Tianjin."}
{"translation": "But there will be a lot of questions in this"}
{"translation": "If you don\u2019t look at him, the fan of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project will tell you that this gorge is called Jiaqiao."}
{"translation": "With his heroes is also very complicated"}
{"translation": "Well, there are indeed many security issues"}
{"translation": "Like the above kind of complaints about two kilometers, the field is full of water"}
{"translation": "Thousands of tons of water puts a lot of pressure on the base of the whole person."}
{"translation": "I feel that we have a variety of sensors on it to monitor its displacement into strong seepage flow, so we built the project safety monitoring accordingly."}
{"translation": "At the same time, let us combine some peripheral weather information, including information from this weather bureau or some local rainfall stations."}
{"translation": "At the same time, we also did some water quantity and water quality monitoring, etc."}
{"translation": "Bring up the TV opportunity to protect the safety of the entire South-to-North Water Diversion Project"}
{"translation": "At the same time, we also built the anti-intrusion play"}
{"translation": "Explain that if someone is afraid that I am embarrassed to enter my channel, I can know that I can find him in advance and point him out."}
{"translation": "I feel that words can also improve the fullness of vocational engineering"}
{"translation": "Let me give you an example"}
{"translation": "Just like this kind of invasion is also a big bank inside"}
{"translation": "This is a manual dug project for us, so once people fall into this channel, it is difficult for you to get up."}
{"translation": "Because this is a concrete slope, it\u2019s very difficult to climb up."}
{"translation": "Although human safety is also a core issue in the entire South-to-North Water Transfer Project"}
{"translation": "Then I talked about some of the previous technical methods of the Internet of Things to solve this or to ensure the safety of this building"}
{"translation": "Whether it\u2019s any bridge, whether it\u2019s this building, whether it\u2019s a highway or a project like this or that."}
{"translation": "The new type of sensor in the future is indeed a very core face-lift in the future, and some realizations can be done in the future."}
{"translation": "When we talk about the future of smart buildings, it must be to update the saturated operation of the building. You know that the entire process of future maintenance needs to be informatized."}
{"translation": "Then the human body, on the one hand, improves the safety level of this building, on the other hand, it also provides some convenience for people\u2019s lives."}
{"translation": "But I can see that our country actually has a lot of flaws in this new sensor."}
{"translation": "On the one hand, we really need a variety of new types of sensors, but my sister sees that especially in the high-end smart sensors"}
{"translation": "The United States, Japan and Germany are relatively advanced, accounting for 70% of the world\u2019s largest, and our country\u2019s is only about 10%."}
{"translation": "So at the same time, from the perspective of production, there are only more than 10,000 in our country."}
{"translation": "So this one is also one of our big shortcomings, then another one is the good things, where are the good things"}
{"translation": "This is our country\u2019s sensor industry"}
{"translation": "From the original imitation, now it has begun to gradually expand to the high-end"}
{"translation": "Some chip factories in our country have begun to gradually move towards high-end line lines"}
{"translation": "Let me give you a simple example"}
{"translation": "Some of our high-speed acceleration gas, including the investment of a sum of money, will be better used in the military industry, and now it is also being transferred to civilian use."}
{"translation": "Then we have some pressure. Now, who is the time table, your eyes are also beginning to apply"}
{"translation": "Including some of the explosion-proof sensors we made, we have already used them during the security check, including Pudong Airport."}
{"translation": "We have some of this millimeter wave equipment, including those at the security checkpoint, which have already been used in these equipment at the airport."}
{"translation": "Having said that, I believe you will be able to achieve breakthroughs in many of our high-end sensors in the next three to five years."}
{"translation": "So with these sensors, we can mention this prefabricated building for the building, especially the future building, and we can provide some more powerful technologies and methods for his safety in the future to escort his safety."}
{"translation": "Thanks everyone"}
