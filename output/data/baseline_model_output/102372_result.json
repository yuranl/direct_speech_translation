{"translation": "Mom\u2019s imperfection may be seen by all of us"}
{"translation": "The two of us met in 1984"}
{"translation": "I was a college student at the time and just graduated from the Academy of Fine Arts"}
{"translation": "Then Apu Na, he just came to the Children\u2019s Palace to learn painting"}
{"translation": "It has been 34 years since 80 years"}
{"translation": "He wants this mild mental retardation we call"}
{"translation": "Let\u2019s take a look and compose it now. He has created more than 4,100 works, including more than 2,000 works of costume paintings and classical music."}
{"translation": "Let&#39;s take a look at Apu now"}
{"translation": "Then I think 34 years ago when such a special child came to our Shanglin Palace, I didn\u2019t realize at all that after 34 years we would have a special education, an integrated education situation."}
{"translation": "Maybe I am a teacher in the Children&#39;s Palace who faces special children"}
{"translation": "His parents couldn\u2019t open his eyes when she was born, he couldn\u2019t even suck milk and his body was limp."}
{"translation": "Then when faced with a child like this, they may really be 10,000. What power can save them?"}
{"translation": "The bottom photo is the one on the left is me and the one on the right is opt"}
{"translation": "We can see a word in such a big scene"}
{"translation": "He is painting with a small body like this waving a paintbrush"}
{"translation": "You can see that he is really a very gifted girl"}
{"translation": "When he published his first album of pictures 20 years ago, we set up an experimental class called Featured Children\u2019s Art in Apuna."}
{"translation": "There are more than 10 of them. We are talking about cerebral palsy, autism, Down syndrome, and so on."}
{"translation": "Play for free and make some of this kid will be in it"}
{"translation": "We hope that a case of Ah Pu Qiangzi can inspire more special children to express themselves through art"}
{"translation": "Then, in 2006, when the work in our area was completed last year, we formally established a special education center to provide special services for toilet children."}
{"translation": "In 10 years, we have the support of Wucai Jin"}
{"translation": "Then provide 2,000 public welfare free degrees to the society every year"}
{"translation": "So far we have 15,000 free degrees"}
{"translation": "So we have seen from more than a dozen children now that there are more than 2,000 degrees like this, we are really grateful"}
{"translation": "Because of OPPO, we were only a small wish at the time, and we are very grateful for what we are today."}
{"translation": "Well, we now have more than 60 art education courses, and at the same time, we have sent teachers home"}
{"translation": "For example, we have a hospital in Guangzhou, some of which are regular and some things are irregular. In the cancer ward, we have art classes and some have music classes."}
{"translation": "Then we will have art classes in the orphanage, etc."}
{"translation": "Then our goal is that we hope that every child can make the best use of their own abilities"}
{"translation": "Every child is unique"}
{"translation": "So that they can be their best selves"}
{"translation": "Then we had a fusion art troupe in 14 years"}
{"translation": "The introduction of Theron\u2019s art troupe is now showing a video for everyone to watch"}
{"translation": "We let you go public for another 20 years, and then we went on the road of special education. Now we see that we have many ordinary children. We are still in a very harmonious time and space with the toilet."}
{"translation": "When I saw this picture, I was really happy and happy in my heart because I really saw this group of children living in harmony."}
{"translation": "We can watch"}
{"translation": "In the past few days, I went to the TV station to film some of the programs we released and did some sorting"}
{"translation": "Then I put it on the Apu filmed on the Art Gallery of Guangdong TV 30 years ago. At that time he was about 10 years old."}
{"translation": "Then he is really addicted to painting"}
{"translation": "Then he walks normally"}
{"translation": "Then I turned to a CCTV show about the quantifiers of the Eastern time and space that crossed Pupu nearly 20 years ago."}
{"translation": "Then he had a serious mental disorder at that time"}
{"translation": "Then it was a picture album that was on a business trip"}
{"translation": "Her mother was still the same young at that time, and the sound of his cigarette was his tears, talking about his worries and his worries."}
{"translation": "20 years have passed"}
{"translation": "Eminem&#39;s mother is gray-haired now"}
{"translation": "Looking forward to the operation and the movement is very inconvenient. Various sicknesses make the body of the material"}
{"translation": "Eminem&#39;s experience of the ups and downs in life"}
{"translation": "For example, because he can urinate, he can\u2019t urinate, he needs to use a urinary catheter"}
{"translation": "So it\u2019s very inconvenient for him to come out every day"}
{"translation": "Then every year he has to go to the hospital for a Pang Guang plastic surgery"}
{"translation": "Life is up and down like this"}
{"translation": "Then it became his normal state for the painter to do rehabilitation operations"}
{"translation": "Then it\u2019s very inconvenient when traveling because it\u2019s not easy to fight"}
{"translation": "In fact, all children with mobility impairments, especially those with cerebral palsy, their parents have an experience that children grow up day by day, their children grow up, mothers and fathers are getting old, and they are increasingly unable to hold their children."}
{"translation": "Then there will be a day when they will never be able to repay their children again"}
{"translation": "At the same time, this very common experience is that when they are struggling, the taxi drivers will never look at him."}
{"translation": "But I want to say that their experience will definitely become ours"}
{"translation": "why"}
{"translation": "Because everyone will get old, everyone may have time when sitting in a wheelchair"}
{"translation": "Recently, my parents are over 80 and over 90"}
{"translation": "They all went to the hospital one after another"}
{"translation": "I watched them aging, my own body is gradually getting old"}
{"translation": "Then my legs and feet sometimes have inconveniences, such as other things that hurt and so on."}
{"translation": "Then I think I can\u2019t guarantee that I won\u2019t be a man in this life"}
{"translation": "So when I get old, maybe one day we will sit in a wheelchair with Apu Quantum or push that intrusive gas"}
{"translation": "Not so much, but we return to the topic of our children\u2019s education and integrated education for 20 years"}
{"translation": "Actually, I really want to tell these special children and their families and their parents that I am grateful for having you"}
{"translation": "Because on the surface for 20 years, have we given you a lot? For example, we just saw on the screen how many degrees we have for them every week, and how many resources we have for them, and how they speak out in front of the public? Express one&#39;s own existence, show one&#39;s talents, etc."}
{"translation": "But what I want to say is that these children gave us the opportunity to regain the love we should have, and love each other and we learn to love our neighbor as ourselves"}
{"translation": "Because we seem to be helping them on the surface, in fact we are helping ourselves"}
{"translation": "To me, no one can guarantee that they will never sit in a wheelchair on crutches"}
{"translation": "I do integrated education because I hope that one day I will get old. When I am in a wheelchair, what I have to fight is that I will pass by because I am in a wheelchair. It\u2019s that simple"}
{"translation": "Today I turned it out and I re-written two paragraphs as the end of my speech today."}
{"translation": "I still don\u2019t know your name, the sugar baby, it\u2019s nice to have you"}
{"translation": "Every day when you are little you are weak, you pounce on me, hug me and kiss me"}
{"translation": "This sudden trust and IE are like a ray of warm sunshine driving away all the haze in my heart that day"}
{"translation": "At that moment you are so powerful as to save the whole world lost for the lack of love"}
{"translation": "And the standard of this society often sees you like this. You are just a flawed or even a useless person."}
{"translation": "It\u2019s nice to have you all the kids in the art troupe"}
{"translation": "Every day in the hustle and bustle of people, I saw that we talked together. A little secretary pushed his little partner, and a child in a wheelchair passed me hurriedly."}
{"translation": "This picture is really so beautiful and he is firmly fixed in my heart"}
{"translation": "Today I have you, I have all of us here. Maybe there is only one purpose. It&#39;s mother&#39;s worries about himself and his son&#39;s worries about our worries about our possibility of sitting in a wheelchair one day."}
{"translation": "Everyone\u2019s similar worries will be a thing of the past"}
{"translation": "Because when we love our neighbor as ourselves"}
{"translation": "When we can warm each other and watch each other and love each other, when we become a community of destiny, will such a moment be far away from us?"}
{"translation": "Because in each other&#39;s love, there will be no more worry and no fear anymore"}
{"translation": "I think this is the greatest significance of integrated education"}
{"translation": "thank you all"}
