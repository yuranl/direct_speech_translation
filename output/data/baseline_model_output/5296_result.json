{"translation": "Thought this is the best time this is the worst time"}
{"translation": "When you see Jiang Changjian, you know that this is the worst of the era. The mobility is obviously shrinking. You can see my figure and you know that this is the best era. The conference is very fluid."}
{"translation": "I want to answer what I just created, why is it Shanghai?"}
{"translation": "To answer this question we have to go back to 170 years ago"}
{"translation": "It is a coincidence that after the signing of the Nanjing Treaty in 1843, after Xiamen in Shanghai became a store in China\u2019s five trade ports"}
{"translation": "Shanghai has entered a rapid development channel"}
{"translation": "This year is 170 years since Shanghai has not opened"}
{"translation": "When Shanghai was opened as a port, the powers of the countries began to come to Shanghai one after another"}
{"translation": "Of course, the situation in Shanghai is different from that in Hong Kong. They established the so-called school concession in Shanghai."}
{"translation": "Renting him becomes a form of culture and a form of foreigners living in Shanghai"}
{"translation": "He is closely linked to the development of Shanghai in 170 years"}
{"translation": "Let\u2019s briefly review the two stages of the development of this concession"}
{"translation": "What kind of living conditions did foreigners like when they came to Shanghai?"}
{"translation": "Huayang Division"}
{"translation": "Then you can\u2019t live with foreigners"}
{"translation": "But in 1853 and 1855, because of the small knife society uprising, a large number of Chinese refugees began to flood into their homes."}
{"translation": "Therefore, the form of existence of monkhood has changed from the separation of Huayang to Huayang."}
{"translation": "Since then he has changed a historical change in Shanghai showing three trends"}
{"translation": "Is that its economy is very prosperous"}
{"translation": "There are a large number of Chinese and Western cultures in this concession, which slowly began to merge"}
{"translation": "Therefore, it is precisely because of this historical development trend that the historical and cultural features of Shanghai as a whole show such a few characteristics, which is probably six characters."}
{"translation": "He is called the center of the ball"}
{"translation": "Accept the wind and rain"}
{"translation": "His thing"}
{"translation": "No. 3 Shanghai is a commercial society, so she was seriously injured"}
{"translation": "He writes"}
{"translation": "Generally speaking, Shanghai\u2019s culture is a citizen\u2019s culture"}
{"translation": "It\u2019s a very down-to-earth form of such a popular culture"}
{"translation": "So why did a group of Jin-style literati represented by the text in the first trial turn Shanghai\u2019s culture into a Shanghai-style culture?"}
{"translation": "Today, when we talk about Shanghai culture, we might think this is a complimentary idea."}
{"translation": "At that time it was a derogatory meaning"}
{"translation": "So Shanghai culture generally shows such a trend"}
{"translation": "Therefore, it is precisely because of such a historical characteristic that its management form has become called China"}
{"translation": "This is very interesting. It is said that in this area, foreigners are mainly foreigners who live as missiles. There are a large number of Chinese who have a living, but the Chinese government can\u2019t control them."}
{"translation": "So in this house, he becomes a very interesting gray area and no one can control him."}
{"translation": "So in this area you can find all kinds of people who do different things"}
{"translation": "For example, here you can find some formerly light Iran, such as Xu Hongji, this Zeng Chuntian, and Zheng Xiaoxu."}
{"translation": "You can find the revolutionary Kang You who was ventilated by the Empress Dowager Cixi. You can also find the Su Bond who shocked the Chinese and foreign countries and took Zhang Taiyan here."}
{"translation": "Of course, the young man of the Chengdu show was born in Shanghai at the earliest"}
{"translation": "It was only later that he was invited by Cai Yuanpei to Beijing, where he moved to Beijing from Shanghai as the dean of literature at Peking University."}
{"translation": "This led to the birth of the May Fourth Movement, the new cultural movement"}
{"translation": "At the same time, the first congress of our Communist Party of China was also in our Luwan District in the French Concession."}
{"translation": "Hit you here today sunday"}
{"translation": "Is the leader of Luwan District"}
{"translation": "You think this is a place in the French Concession, so you can find all kinds of different political differences and political forces in the entire middle."}
{"translation": "At the same time, he has also begun to show a trend of vigorous development in various cultural thoughts and artistic development fields."}
{"translation": "You were talking about this technology just now"}
{"translation": "He has always been that calligraphy and painting review"}
{"translation": "I often say an example of Shanghai style painting"}
{"translation": "People from all over the country who wanted to achieve something in this conversation or say you want to make a lot of money must come to Shanghai"}
{"translation": "There are two of the big three of Shanghai style painting, none of them is Shanghai, but one butt is Shanghainese"}
{"translation": "The other two inconstants and Ren Bonian, one from Huzhou and the other from Samsung Shaoxing"}
{"translation": "In his old age, Wuchang said he has been living in Suzhou"}
{"translation": "He was thinking of selling paintings in Shanghai, but he thought it was a paradise for adventurers, and he didn\u2019t dare to design it casually."}
{"translation": "He sent one of his students to be an attendant to Shanghai to explore the way"}
{"translation": "So sure enough, a year later, Zhao Yun is making a lot of money"}
{"translation": "Today, you can see the paintings of his student in many auction houses"}
{"translation": "It can be said that the painting is shoddy and far from the teacher"}
{"translation": "We can also see Wuhufen\u2019s very low evaluation of this person in Wu Hufan\u2019s diary."}
{"translation": "But Wuchang said that seeing his students do not paint well, he can still make so much money in Shanghai."}
{"translation": "Therefore, under the kind invitation of his good friend Wang Yiting, the comprador of Nissin Company, he moved from Suzhou to Shanghai and started an important development trend of Shanghai style painting with Ren Bonian and Xugu."}
{"translation": "Therefore, there are not so many famous artists like Zhang Daqian and Liu Haisu who have come to the constant item in Shanghai without Shanghai."}
{"translation": "Similarly, we always say where is the birthplace of Chinese oil painting"}
{"translation": "Just in shanghai"}
{"translation": "Why is the oil painting born in Shanghai"}
{"translation": "This is because a large number of foreign missionaries came to Shanghai after the opening of the port. Now everyone sees the Catholic Church in Xujiahui."}
{"translation": "This Catholic church later became a called Tushanwan Guild Hall. It is now recognized that this is a cradle of Chinese painting."}
{"translation": "Today everyone heard that Tushanmen Guild Hall is a very nice name. It is Shi Shang and he is an orphanage."}
{"translation": "In order to let those lonely and helpless orphans grow up to be able to return to society, they can only have their own words. These missionaries from various European countries use art to enlighten their psychology and cultivate their future ability to rely on art. Such a craft that can survive in this society"}
{"translation": "Today we all know that some of the painters who graduated from this school are all populace. We can only say the famous sculptor Mr. Zhang Chongren"}
{"translation": "Mr. Zhang Chuan is also the only Chinese artist who has caused great repercussions in Europe because the author of Ding Ding is a very good friend."}
{"translation": "Some people even say that the image of Ding Ding is a reference to Zhang Chongren"}
{"translation": "Mr. Zhang Buy Nian is regarded as a master in France."}
{"translation": "His Mitterrand shot them all marked to take a photo"}
{"translation": "So it is said that she can come and go in your hands at will when she is in Paris in her later years"}
{"translation": "There is also Liu Haisu who is always called Zhou Jiang, so there is no Liu Haisu without Zhou Xiang."}
{"translation": "Without Liu Haisu, there is no such a career as the education of Chinese oil painting that Liu Haisu created later."}
{"translation": "Liu Haisu\u2019s Shanghai Beauty Academy is the first in China to use the human body to sketch from life"}
{"translation": "At that time, it was unimaginable that a girl with her naked body was being talked about by a group of men in a classroom"}
{"translation": "But it is because of Shanghai that he can have such an open mind and such a mindset of being inclusive of all rivers, that makes Chinese painting, especially oil painting art, have made great progress."}
{"translation": "Let me talk about the golden song"}
{"translation": "In Beijing, we usually watch Beijing and go to Shanghai. People call the theater. Beijing people call the weather because Beijing people only pay attention to listening."}
{"translation": "However, after arriving in Shanghai today, it has become the so-called Shanghai Peking Opera."}
{"translation": "Let me give you an example. Of course, this artist is called a representative figure of Peking Opera."}
{"translation": "But I can say that there is no Shanghai and there is no such a long line of his entire art and can continue to influence all the people who love and listen to today."}
{"translation": "This person is called Mei Lanfang"}
{"translation": "Mei Lanfang&#39;s first visit to Shanghai was in 1914 when he was 20 years old"}
{"translation": "At that time, when Mei Lanfang arrived in Shanghai, he was an ordinary pinball actor who was unknown."}
{"translation": "He was the second generation official in his performance in Shanghai"}
{"translation": "That top brand is called Wang Fengqing"}
{"translation": "You can tell from the difference between his pack wins at the time that this barrier is strong"}
{"translation": "Back then, Wang Fengqing\u2019s package should be 45 days minus 45 days, and the package win was 3800. I didn\u2019t see it. It\u2019s only about 1,400."}
{"translation": "Then I heard the request repeatedly on the Internet and added 400 yuan, which is about 1,800 yuan."}
{"translation": "When Mei Lanfang came to Shanghai for the second time, Mei Lanfang was the top card. There were still more than 4000 to 5000. Dayang Wang Fengqing picked up about half of the original."}
{"translation": "So every time Mei Lanfang performed in Shanghai for the first time in 1914 was very important in his life."}
{"translation": "First of all, he thinks the Shanghai stage is very beautiful. In the past, the theater in Beijing was very dim, but when he went to Shanghai, he saw that the Shanghai stage was not big but very bright."}
{"translation": "Because of what"}
{"translation": "If you look up again, there are generally very bright light bulbs. It seems to be the so-called red light or LED today."}
{"translation": "He thinks this is very good in such a novel way"}
{"translation": "And for the first time, I discovered that Shanghai\u2019s economic stage is actually chasing light"}
{"translation": "There are so many chasing lights"}
{"translation": "The theater in Beijing vomited nothing"}
{"translation": "He thinks that the Shanghai actresses on stage have more votes than the northern actors"}
{"translation": "He began to research and find out what the makeup method of eye circles is different"}
{"translation": "The words of Beijing actors are very big, so when you are standing on the stage, the actor\u2019s eyes are not big enough or enlightened enough"}
{"translation": "The usual eye circles of Shanghai&#39;s representative actors are very dark and very dark. After the lights on the stage are illuminated, they look very bright and the eyes look very big."}
{"translation": "When I inquired, it was said that Shanghai&#39;s actresses had learned a lot from this Hollywood movie. This useful experience"}
{"translation": "How many stickers for singing Peking opera"}
{"translation": "The actor&#39;s stickers in Beijing are all pasted with a square, and the face is very short and not good-looking"}
{"translation": "This hairstyle is nothing Shanghai actor&#39;s patch is different from the north"}
{"translation": "Later, I had no money to live on this stage for 40 years, and I specially summed up the four words called Gao before and after."}
{"translation": "Shanghainese are smart"}
{"translation": "Different people have different face shapes in different ways of patching"}
{"translation": "If this patch for a thinner person, then the back of the face will look bigger"}
{"translation": "This is a common one in the future"}
{"translation": "If you have a fat face like me, then I&#39;ll go back almost one day the day before"}
{"translation": "If this is a short one, he will post a bit higher and shorter"}
{"translation": "If this point is longer, then he posted the next one"}
{"translation": "This really didn&#39;t come to put a major trend"}
{"translation": "Ten days later, Mei Pai Art, his gentle and elegant on stage, his grace and generosity are inseparable from studying with Shanghai Peking Opera actors in Shanghai."}
{"translation": "But this is all appearance"}
{"translation": "What&#39;s more important"}
{"translation": "More importantly, he learned that kind of innovative spirit in Shanghai, so that kind of innovative spirit brought great inspiration and shock to Mr. Mei."}
{"translation": "After returning to Beijing, I had no money, and I joined the so-called U.S. Party members around him. They also arranged a lot of new dramas, shot the Indonesian Ma Xiang Deng Xia Bone."}
{"translation": "So in Mei Lanfang\u2019s life, innovation became an important main axis of his art."}
{"translation": "Therefore, at the end of his later life, the last play he rehearsed has also become the most unseen play, that is, Mu Guiying is in charge."}
{"translation": "It&#39;s from Henan Opera teacher Ma Jinfeng all the time"}
{"translation": "I can say that there is no Shanghai and there is no Mei Lanfang who later became a master of Peking opera"}
{"translation": "So today we are on the streets of Shanghai, what impresses us most is the many international buildings on the Bund."}
{"translation": "Among so many buildings, there is an dictation called Ha"}
{"translation": "This art has only survived in Europe for more than 20 years"}
{"translation": "Shanghai is second only to Czechoslovakia in the world&#39;s most ahtingpu architecture"}
{"translation": "Why can a homeless man like Wu Da Ke find his place in Shanghai? This is the charm of Shanghai"}
{"translation": "Shanghai&#39;s movies, Shanghai&#39;s dramas, Shanghai&#39;s popular songs are even more numerous"}
{"translation": "So whether it\u2019s literary drama or other music, Shanghai will become such a big integration"}
{"translation": "He can be the focus of a world\u2019s attention so it doesn\u2019t come out of thin air"}
{"translation": "In 170, Shanghai changed from a small thread along the coast to a magical capital that the whole world has attracted attention."}
{"translation": "In this, we can study his entire development process"}
{"translation": "Therefore, Time Magazine commented on Shanghai once and said that Shanghai is the darling of the times, and it is a mixture of history."}
{"translation": "This is why Shanghai will present such a colorful thoughts in Shanghai, and will present so many colorful artists and artistic atmospheres."}
{"translation": "This is why the topic of my speech today is Shanghai"}
