{"translation": "Part of it is some creative methods that I often use and I also hope to share with you"}
{"translation": "Finally, it is also an attitude of slow life creation"}
{"translation": "Maybe these parts"}
{"translation": "Let everyone watch for a few more seconds"}
{"translation": "Because I have been in the industry for 32 years"}

{"translation": "In 1984, in 1985, I had your Huang Yangming with two friends. At that time, the two of them were about to form a male music group."}

{"translation": "Gradually, the lyricist became the producer of the concert, and the planning also included the production of the album of the song, etc."}

{"translation": "Did the music take off at the time?"}
{"translation": "Many people came to Beijing and Shanghai to do some music projects for me"}
{"translation": "At that time, I frankly said that there was a little imbalance in my heart"}
{"translation": "what"}
{"translation": "But I searched Baidu\u2019s music charts"}

{"translation": "The reason for this can be explained in the next part 2."}
{"translation": "Crossover art"}
{"translation": "Since I was born, I think I have a kind of natural ability. Is it because I see some pictures and see stories? I can easily convert it into simple words."}

{"translation": "I can now turn the original text into lyrics"}
{"translation": "In my junior high school"}
{"translation": "I often change some English songs into Chinese songs and comprehend the lyrics of many different themes."}
{"translation": "Then I went to the graphic design of the junior college I studied after graduating from high school."}
{"translation": "Finally, I will slowly convert this ability into a photographer or even painting, and even later I like to force the model to be a three-dimensional thing."}
{"translation": "It\u2019s not that I see many different experiences in life that make me like to turn it into a creative work"}
{"translation": "It\u2019s just some photos I took with film"}
{"translation": "The most unlucky thing is to cooperate with me"}
{"translation": "That time I recorded with them or filmed commercials"}
{"translation": "In fact, besides telling them whether I want to be formal at the scene, I actually like to let him let them be my models and let me take pictures."}
{"translation": "I don&#39;t care if they like it or not"}
{"translation": "You should know how you feel when you look at their helpless eyes"}
{"translation": "But they respect it and don\u2019t know that I like it the most convenient in life"}
{"translation": "painting"}

{"translation": "This is when I\u2019m flying, if it\u2019s a very short flight, about two or three hours, I\u2019m sure to make the soil luxurious."}
{"translation": "So when I saw 59 repairing some magazines and aviation magazines, I just drew it in two or two hours."}
{"translation": "But the one at the bottom left is looking for Li Jiaxing, that is what I said is a fine"}
{"translation": "Fine sketch"}
{"translation": "It\u2019s almost all the time, that is, each one is used for 100 hours"}
{"translation": "And every day, two or three hours"}
{"translation": "Go home and spend a few hours"}
{"translation": "Then it takes one month, two months or even half a year to complete"}
{"translation": "These texture pressures are also traced according to the hair."}
{"translation": "Through this process, I am able to talk to my own sexual desires. I think it gives me more time to conceive and all works."}
{"translation": "This is because art is connected, the number of ants is the same"}
{"translation": "Many people have asked me how it is the same"}
{"translation": "Then I will introduce the three parts of 156 introduction"}
{"translation": "Are some of the creative methods I often use"}
{"translation": "Imbalance, asymmetry, contrast and sublimation are some of the techniques I often use"}
{"translation": "One is very simple"}
{"translation": "It is unbalanced asymmetry from the imbalance on the screen, such as the size of the object before and after"}
{"translation": "The one in the upper right corner"}
{"translation": "Odd and odd people face many thousands of passersby"}
{"translation": "This kind of asymmetry and unbalance on the picture"}
{"translation": "The other is contrast. Contrast is the contrast of colors."}
{"translation": "Early in the morning"}
{"translation": "One after another"}
{"translation": "That is, the contrast between black and white and red"}
{"translation": "The number in the lower left corner is also a color contrast"}
{"translation": "I want to mention that there is a sentence on the soda can that I created myself"}
{"translation": "You can&#39;t see"}
{"translation": "This is love what is your heart"}
{"translation": "Look at the word 20"}
{"translation": "If the last letter H is brought to the front, it becomes Hi"}
{"translation": "This is a closing point I came up with"}
{"translation": "China"}
{"translation": "Then many people say that art is a kind of sublimation extracted from life"}
{"translation": "12 What is life?"}
{"translation": "What I want to share is because I see something very often and feel very uncharacteristic. Do you have the ability to see something different?"}
{"translation": "I like modified models"}
{"translation": "Put some normal and ordinary things to turn it into extraordinary things"}
{"translation": "For example, this Polaroid camera, me, I saw his look, I thought it was very interesting, then I saw that I could change it into something"}
{"translation": "Then I will buy it back, take it apart and paint it with colors to turn it into a spaceship and add some parts that people will continue to paint."}
{"translation": "Then I also criticized the map to help him become something like a poster"}
{"translation": "Then the most important thing is to download and go back to the original point. You can still take pictures."}
{"translation": "It&#39;s still a normal Polaroid"}
{"translation": "This is also a kind of inspiration in life and a kind of sublimation"}
{"translation": "This is the draft I have made"}
{"translation": "Sleep for a long time"}
{"translation": "Inquired about some models that have been collected slowly, but there is no time to make them"}
{"translation": "I have always wanted to change the volume for your car and convert it into that helicopter"}
{"translation": "I have a friend who is a parent he studied"}
{"translation": "He asked me one day and said"}
{"translation": "Xiaoqi, you don\u2019t have so much interest in creating more"}
{"translation": "Then how do you think it is possible to cultivate his children to have some more focused, some literacy and some interests"}
{"translation": "Then I ask him a question"}
{"translation": "I ask you besides buying him the latest mobile phones and the latest computer notebooks. Did you train him to have some works that take a long time to complete? Things are tasks, for example, one month, six months, and more than one year."}
{"translation": "Looking at me quietly means that there is no"}
{"translation": "Then I said you hurry up and do it"}
{"translation": "Because now the new media high-tech AI"}
{"translation": "If you want children to look at this era, look different from others in this era"}
{"translation": "Then you should give him some more mobile phones and laptops. At the same time, he will also train him some works and tasks that need to be painted well for a long, long time to complete."}
{"translation": "Because there are fewer and fewer people who can do this kind of thing"}
{"translation": "This is the first kind of artistic sublimation that I told him"}
{"translation": "Diao kind of sublimation is"}
{"translation": "Too much information"}
{"translation": "Tomorrow, we will turn on the phone, watch WeChat, and open Weibo. Many good things, bad things are related to us, things are not closed, we can accept everything and it\u2019s easy to accept"}
{"translation": "So I give him one thing that is to try my best to upgrade his judgment and aesthetic standards."}
{"translation": "What is it"}
{"translation": "This is for us not to take time to criticize some bad things and to take time to wipe some people we don\u2019t know"}
{"translation": "Conversely, we will only spend time to appreciate the things that we think are good, and time to praise the works that we think are good"}
{"translation": "This will make your own aesthetic standards more pure"}
{"translation": "As part of it I want to share is to live hard and slow"}
{"translation": "Is a popular term called slow fire?"}
{"translation": "A lot of contacts and connections represent a very loose life"}
{"translation": "It\u2019s sold for three hours after making it in coffee. Actually, it\u2019s not in my shop."}
{"translation": "Slow fire actually requires a lot of hard work"}
{"translation": "You just saw the creation of many works I did"}
{"translation": "So I am a little bit bigger"}
{"translation": "Even if I am interested in playing something, I am also a very hardworking"}
{"translation": "Because you don\u2019t just spend hundreds of hours talking and swear words and then use a combination model"}
{"translation": "Besides, family is related to making money"}
{"translation": "I want to share it is the golden age of Hong Kong music scene"}
{"translation": "A group of creators in Weifang, they are also very diligent Leslie Cheung and Anita Mui before the conference"}
{"translation": "I won&#39;t talk about it today"}
{"translation": "You probably have all heard their stories"}
{"translation": "Explain that he used to be in the amusement park"}
{"translation": "I just want to practice singing and dancing every day"}
{"translation": "Only later can I become a queen on stage"}
{"translation": "Is this my slow life?"}
{"translation": "It\u2019s also the way I use my life to reflect the imbalance and asymmetry that I should talk about before you"}
{"translation": "why"}
{"translation": "Until today, I still listen to black records and it\u2019s very inefficient"}
{"translation": "Music phones can find thousands of songs and tens of thousands of songs with any app"}
{"translation": "But I still like to listen to the dark and inefficient"}
{"translation": "I&#39;ll turn over that record in 15 minutes"}
{"translation": "Photo film photo"}
{"translation": "Refit"}
{"translation": "It\u2019s very convenient to drive any car, but I still like modified bicycles"}
{"translation": "Find some parts when learning the weather online"}
{"translation": "This is not expensive at all, it just takes time"}
{"translation": "Through the process of this dish, I gradually have a deep feeling for everything I have."}
{"translation": "There are some things in Lele"}
{"translation": "All the information in our new media is forgettable in everything"}
{"translation": "Get quickly and forget quickly"}
{"translation": "So I just live slowly through it, then I make me cherish the things I can get even more"}
{"translation": "Recently I also like to make a model of a house"}
{"translation": "I want to add you in building a railway model"}
{"translation": "I just want to take the initiative to come out of that small city in Japan"}
{"translation": "This is also very time consuming"}
{"translation": "It takes a long time for you to get a moon house"}
{"translation": "So I\u2019m looking forward to many artists, singers and cooperators who are recording"}
{"translation": "I told them that I was very lucky to be able to survive in this circle, a must-have attitude"}
{"translation": "Except for the packaging, besides the set of people"}
{"translation": "Your attitude towards this kind of attitude in life is a necessary condition for you to be able to go on for a long time."}
{"translation": "Pop art pop culture has been developed for so many years now"}
{"translation": "What we call creation is actually very difficult to start from scratch, from scratch, that is, to bring the national character carrier out of the invention center&#39;s song will say what the shape will be difficult, difficult"}
{"translation": "Cold, don\u2019t talk about eternity"}
{"translation": "So even long-term diligence is necessary"}
{"translation": "As today&#39;s protagonist"}
{"translation": "I want to tell you the story behind each song"}
{"translation": "This song is about Leslie Cheung"}
{"translation": "Because April is the season to miss Leslie Cheung"}
{"translation": "If Leslie Cheung decided to quit the music scene in 1990"}
{"translation": "Tomorrow night some of us will have dinner at that Chinese restaurant in Hong Kong"}
{"translation": "Then when he mentioned people, he just wanted to quit Lele\u2019s orchestra"}
{"translation": "Then I told him that your famous works continue to blow the school spirit"}
{"translation": "Then I want to write a song about wind"}
