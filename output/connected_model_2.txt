solution to the problem."}{"translation": "It's the support of the entire body.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "If the body is supported by four points, the support will be rather stable in the process.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "What if it is supported by three points?", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "To keep the balance on the ground, there must be at least three force bearing points.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "The body will lose gravity if there are only two points.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "In that case, there will be a rebound.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "The body rebounds, and falls to the ground.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "And with the inertia of the rebound, it falls to the ground, and rebounds again.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "All her strength is controlled by an invisible line.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "Standing back on the ground is more a result of the rebound.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "But lying on the ground keeps your body closer to the ground and the magnetic field itself.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "And makes the support points more diverse.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "It is three-dimensional, and though constantly repetition, becomes four-dimensional.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "This way, we can feel every moment and every body part.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "Let's return to the topic of ground.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "Let's take a look at the coherent movements on the ground.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "Draw a circle, repeat the cycle, experience weightlessness, fall and rebound, and pull herself to stand, and fall to the ground.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "The last thing I want to talk about is spinning.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "We can see the previous movement involves a lot of spin which is one of the most valuable movements.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "In the training of our early works.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "We found through our study on walking and on center of gravity, that there involves the turning in the process.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "Our ankles, heels, soles, and toes all move in a circle on the ground and keeping turning.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "And turning seems to be the ultimate and the most mysterious secret of all living things.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "The flowers also spin, the world spins and our thoughts are spinning between us.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "Just like a whirlpool, the turning produces energy and brings us together.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "You can enjoy a whole set of turning by our dancer.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "And in the process, we can perceive the relationship between the multidimensional space, the internal vision, external vision, and suspension.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "Ok, it\u2019s finished.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "Excellent!", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "Ok, my sincere thanks to the dancer.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "The performance brings us to the topic of internal vision, external vision, and multidimensional space.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "We have a term called the \"Golden Eyes\".", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "That is, when the dancer turns, he or she can't see anything but glittering flashes like on a roller coaster.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "So the dancer must be very clear about her standpoint during her turning.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "And about the point she need to focus on next.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "All this must be determined when the dancer turns to the right or to left, or forward.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "As she turns and loses balance, her body is like in a space in universe, without support and hanging.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "And all the space will become her center of gravity.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "So this is the process of forming a circle from the spins which we have been looking for.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "This requires the dancer's body to be fully developed.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "The dancer has to go through constant training and practice to find a linearity of imbalance, inertia, connection, transformation and rebound.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "And the practice of turning helps to develop the \"circular movement system\".", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "This marks one stage of our ten-year development.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "The circle means the source of life and our body itself.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "It\u2019s also the starting point.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "That is, every movement you make will motive you to throw a question.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "What's next if I make this move?", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "This is a question.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "And next how can I answer the question?", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "It is answering the question.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "So this is a constant process of asking questions and providing answers.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "Find an answer, and throw a question, and then find an answer before moving to the next question. It is a cycle.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "And how do you move in this cycle?", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "Why moving?", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "How we move is a process in which meanings are produced and it requires a lot of thinking.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "We integrate our imagination, consciousness, rational thinking with our body.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "In the development of the circular movement.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "I remember that a very famous architect called Gaudi said that \"The curve lines belong to God\".", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "Let's get down to our business.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "Our bodies are full of curves, and our lives are full of curves.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "Our foreheads, ears, chins, noses, lips, and every inch of our body, are all curved, and they all flow.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "The curves form a kind of cycle.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "Every inch of the body can be connected.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "And in that process, even your hair is cylinder-like.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "And the flowing process creates an eternal movement, the flow of consciousness.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "It is important to \"draw circles with imaginary pens\" when the dancer dances in circles.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "Oh, let's have a quick interaction.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "Just remain seated and try to communicate with me through your head and shoulders.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "Imagine we have a pen mounted on top of our head.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "Just close your eyes and listen to me.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "You can now try to draw a circle with the tip of the pen.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "It doesn't have to be a complete circle.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "It can be an irregular one.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "After that, we can slowly switch to the left earlobe.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "With the earlobe, we can draw the circle clock-wise and counterclockwise.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "Then you can try to draw circles with you right shoulder, your armpits, elbows, wrists, or your ring finger.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "All your body parts can be a pen.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "It can be your nose or lips.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "It can also be your collarbone, side ribs, or your tailbone, knees, and even your toes.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "So far, I can draw circles with four invisible pens.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "I have the four invisible pens which grow out of my body and draw different circles.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "Elbows and back of the ear with the toes and wrists, or with the back of the head and knees.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "Isn't it interesting?", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "There are endless combinations that expand your scope of imagination.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "This imagination can help you develop your consciousness and body.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "Every time the movements are different but you can still store some of them in the memory.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "And then you try to look for the lost part, think about it, and then transform it by creating an infinite circle.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "The infinite circle.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "That infinity comes from the support of our spine.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "The spine is our axis and it allows us to stand and walk.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "What\u2019s more, it seems to bestow dignity on us and equips us with the ability to look far away and support ourselves.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "But the spine can be further developed in our movements.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "Because we have a limited vision and listening ability.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "We stand facing a flat world.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "But with the spinning, twisting, folding, opening and closing of our spine, the space of our body can be developed and twisted.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "And our vision is broadened as our body can be folded and turned.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "The spine also gives a spatial sense to our hands, feet and hips.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "The connection of the spine allows us to produce endless movements across all points, lines, and planes of our body.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "Like an electrocardiogram,

time.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "These represent our physical world and our spiritual world.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "We have the ability to see, hear, and smell.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "From the linguistic expression, breathing,

me.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "You can hear my voice and I can feel your breath.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "Dance connects all this together.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "Dance becomes a form of connection that allows dancers to

to the problem."}{"translation": "Huang Li is an excellent dancer in our theater and we have worked together for three years.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "She also performs in one of the videos I just showed.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "Well, her body is not a typical woman's body, rolling over, and seems very androgynous.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "We don't distinguish between women and men in our theater.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "In fact, androgyny is the most powerful characteristic.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "Being androgynous means that one can be both powerful and soft.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "This is the plasticity of the body.", "prediction": "We

to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "So I have been telling dancers not to be obsessed with the moment on stage.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "On stage, they are overwhelmed by your attention and applause.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "But when the curtain falls, they retreat into loneliness and endless emptiness.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "So we have to feel the concentration at every moment, the connection

"We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "And each process or each movement will become a texture.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "In making the sculpture, the time unfolds itself.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "And our body becomes the materialization and a measure of time.",

speeds in breaths, heartbeats, and stomach squirming, but that's the magic of nature.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "It ensures a balance of time in the body.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "The degree and speed of our movement are an expression of time.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the

need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "Because each living body has its own sense of time.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "And the process of time becomes a complete expression.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "Because dance is not a point, a line or a plane.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "It is an ongoing and non-stop process.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "As long as you're still alive and the world still exists, your breathing will still be there, and the whole process is the expression of time.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "So I often stress that the expression of dance should not focus on a certain moment.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "But on the connection, or the process.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "In our years of exploration.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "I come to feel the ultimate power of passing the baton of dancing to future generations.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "I want to share a little story.", "prediction":

"At the initial stage, only three of us struggled to perform our work on stage.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "But as we become older and our body grows weak.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "We are gradually drifting away from the stage.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "So whenever we see dancers still expressing themselves purely, clearly and attentively on the stage.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "The three of us will be moved to tears.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "Because I feel these emerging artists have played an increasingly important part in performing dance on stage.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "It is a kind of spirit, an emotion, a resonance of our spiritual world.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "This is a continuation.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "And dance is not about individuals.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "It is about the relationship between people.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "It is about people and life.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "Because rather than rendering people lonely, dance connects the whole world together.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "Making people feel the connection with other people, and it allows people to integrate with nature

solution to the problem."}{"translation": "They strike a chord with other dancers or people by watching and imitating their dances and by dancing to retain the moment.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "Our next plan is a nomadic plan that grows out of our long-term performance tour.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "This plan follows the lifestyle of the nomads.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "We bring dances and perform them in different cities and spaces in China.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "It doesn't have to be a theater.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "It could be a school or any public space.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "Such as the art gallery, as long as we can communicate like this on the scene.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "We can see the sweat, and feel the breath.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "We can see or hear it in its most original form.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "And let people connect with each other on the spot.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "And the connection itself is the benefit of dance.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the

passed.", "prediction": "We need to find a solution to the problem."}{"translation": "We can retain it the next second by constantly repeating the movement to achieve eternity.", "prediction": "We
