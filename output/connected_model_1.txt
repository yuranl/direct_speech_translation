rebounds, and falls to the ground.", "prediction": "That's all."}{"translation": "And with the inertia of the rebound, it falls to the ground, and rebounds again.", "prediction": "That's all."}{"translation": "All her strength is controlled by an invisible line.", "prediction": "That's all."}{"translation": "Standing back on the ground is more a result of the rebound.", "prediction": "That's all."}{"translation": "But lying on the ground keeps your body closer to the ground and the magnetic field itself.", "prediction": "That's all."}{"translation": "And makes the support points more diverse.", "prediction": "That's all."}{"translation": "It is three-dimensional, and though constantly repetition, becomes four-dimensional.", "prediction": "That's all."}{"translation": "This way, we can feel every moment and every body part.", "prediction": "That's all."}{"translation": "Let's return to the topic of ground.", "prediction": "That's all."}{"translation": "Let's take a look

finished.", "prediction": "That's all."}{"translation": "Excellent!", "prediction": "That's all."}{"translation": "Ok, my sincere thanks to the dancer.", "prediction": "That's all."}{"translation": "The performance brings us to the topic of internal vision, external vision, and multidimensional space.", "prediction": "That's all."}{"translation": "We have a term called the \"Golden Eyes\".", "prediction": "That's all."}{"translation": "That is, when the dancer turns, he or she can't see anything but glittering flashes like on a roller coaster.", "prediction": "That's all."}{"translation": "So the dancer must be very clear about her standpoint during her turning.", "prediction": "That's all."}{"translation": "And about the point she need to focus on next.", "prediction": "That's all."}{"translation": "All this must be determined when the dancer turns to the right or to left, or forward.", "prediction": "That's all."}{"translation": "As she turns and loses balance, her body is like in a space in universe, without support and hanging.", "prediction": "That's all."}{"translation": "And all the space will become her center of gravity.", "prediction": "That's all."}{"translation": "So this is the process of forming a circle from the spins which we have been looking for.", "prediction": "That's all."}{"translation": "This requires the dancer's body to be fully developed.", "prediction": "That's all."}{"translation": "The dancer has to go through constant training and practice to find a linearity of imbalance, inertia, connection, transformation and rebound.", "prediction": "That's all."}{"translation": "And the practice of turning helps to develop the \"circular movement system\".", "prediction": "That's all."}{"translation": "This marks one stage of our ten-year development.", "prediction": "That's all."}{"translation": "The circle means the source of life and our body itself.", "prediction": "That's all."}{"translation": "It\u2019s also the starting point.", "prediction": "That's all."}{"translation": "That is, every movement you make will motive you to throw a question.", "prediction": "That's all."}{"translation": "What's next if I make this move?", "prediction": "That's all."}{"translation": "This is a question.", "prediction": "That's all."}{"translation": "And next how can I answer the question?", "prediction": "That's all."}{"translation": "It is answering the question.", "prediction": "That's all."}{"translation": "So this is a constant process of asking questions and providing answers.", "prediction": "That's all."}{"translation": "Find an answer, and throw a question, and then find an answer before moving to the next question. It is a cycle.", "prediction": "That's all."}{"translation": "And how do you move in this cycle?", "prediction": "That's all."}{"translation": "Why moving?", "prediction": "That's all."}{"translation": "How we move is a process in which meanings are produced and it requires a lot of thinking.", "prediction": "That's all."}{"translation": "We integrate our imagination,

connected.", "prediction": "That's all."}{"translation": "And in that process, even your hair is cylinder-like.", "prediction": "That's all."}{"translation": "And the flowing process creates an

all."}{"translation": "It can be an irregular one.", "prediction": "That's all."}{"translation": "After that, we can slowly switch to the left earlobe.", "prediction": "That's all."}{"translation": "With the earlobe, we can draw the circle clock-wise and counterclockwise.", "prediction": "That's all."}{"translation": "Then you can try to draw circles with you right shoulder, your armpits,

"That's all."}{"translation": "There are endless combinations that expand your scope of imagination.", "prediction": "That's all."}{"translation": "This imagination can help you develop your consciousness and body.", "prediction": "That's all."}{"translation": "Every time the movements are different but you can still store some of them in the memory.", "prediction": "That's all."}{"translation": "And then you try to look for the lost part, think about it, and then transform it by creating an infinite circle.", "prediction": "That's all."}{"translation": "The infinite circle.", "prediction": "That's all."}{"translation": "That infinity comes from the support of our spine.", "prediction": "That's all."}{"translation": "The spine is our axis and it allows us to stand

"That's all."}{"translation": "But the spine can be further developed in our movements.", "prediction": "That's all."}{"translation": "Because we have a limited vision and listening ability.",

research.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "It sounds like it doesn't have much to do with dance.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "Dance is a primitive form of art, so some people call it the mother of art.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "That may be a little bit exaggerated.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "But my previous understanding of dance tells me it lives well up to that honor, because it involves the body.",

about."}{"translation": "It draws on the body and its movements to communicate, accumulate and convey the purest message.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "Well, the body is actually a concept in pan-art.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "The body, combined with any carrier, will convey ideas.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "For example, the body can be a script, or a museum.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "The body is also the origin of our life, that is, the carrier of our life.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "So dance with our body is the expression of time and also of vitality.", "prediction":

some of the dances.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "But I wouldn\u2019t say I would try to \"understand\" what the dances want to express.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "Because to me, dance is a vocabulary, not a language.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "It contains both visual and auditory vocabulary.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "And the integration of the vocabularies on the scene forms an expression of vocabulary.",

like to talk about."}{"translation": "You can just grab some sleep, lying comfortably on the seat, and continue watching when you wake up.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "Well, this is how I usually communicate with my audience.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "Because I think it is the feelings that make it possible to build a space where people could communicate smoothly with each other.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "Whether you understand dance or not.",

movements.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "Actually, movement research is a direction we have long been exploring.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "One interesting thing about the body is that the flesh has limits, we have only two arms and two legs.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "But in dancing, the movements of the body can be so diverse.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "This is fascinating!", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "The movements can be totally different.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "But even with the same movement or the same order, different dancers can create a different world.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "So I feel the study of the body brings me back to the purest way of expression.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "One area we have been exploring is the extent to which the plasticity, mobility, and physical limits of the body can be developed.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "Well, now I'll move to the main topic today.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "This is going to be very, very informative but it may seem different from the usual dance.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "But I want to try it today.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "Let's get down to our business.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "Body, substance, space, gravity, throwing force and weight.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "First, let us consider body as substance.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "This may seem to be a self-evident topic to you, isn't it?", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "We are the product of the fusion of substances.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "The body is life itself, and it is also an origin of our life.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "Of course, life is a substance by which we can communicate with each other.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "There is another concept about dance that I wanted to mention previously but forgot to.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "For dancing, it is \"I move, therefore I am.\"", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "Rather than \"I think, therefore I am\".", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "Sustances are expressed through movements whose existence is worth exploring.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "The second point is about space and gravity.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "Well, we live in a world with gravity.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "The world has a magnetic field and our body either confronts or reconciles with this magnetic field.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "And the planet, and anything else is influenced by gravity.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "Including natural laws, the formation of four seasons, and many other physical effects.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "The throwing force is equal to the weight of the object being thrown.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "This means our movement is also a process of working against the gravity.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "To make a vivid metaphor, the process is just like when you are throwing out an object.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "The distance the object travels and the force on it when it falls is in proportion to the force you exert.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "Therefore, every movement we make is an act of throwing.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "Whether you're walking or squatting, you're making a transition of power, throwing youself out, and bringing yourself back the next moment.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "Well, what I have shared so far seems like a physics class.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "Well, it is.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "But this is going to be a very interesting physics class.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "Now, I want to invite a dancer from our theater to come on stage.",

talk about."}{"translation": "Well, please welcome our dancer!", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "I'd like to start with how we stand.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "The space we've just mentioned is consciously structured by our consciousness in the process of standing.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "There's a lot of consciousness involved in our standing.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "Start with the support.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "The soles support our ankles.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "Our ankles support our knees.", "prediction":

soles.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "This is the supporting mechanics of our body.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "But the body is not dead.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "It is animate.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "So the mechanics of the body are the most animate building, because it is changeable.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "When we stand, we mentally divide the space into many parts.",

like to talk about."}{"translation": "In this area, the mirror we face will undergo constant refractions.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "From the front, to the back, the left, the right, the up, the down, and the center.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "Her shoulders are relaxed.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "Her back is stretched from the hair to the caudal vertebra.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "She breathes in and out as she open her eyes.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "The ear and the shoulder blade are unfolded.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "Every moment she stands, she communicates through her breath.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "This is her sense of time.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "She feels her body continually sinking down, heavier and deeper down towards the ground.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "The support itself helps her to feel the weight of standing.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "The standing position is a scientific posture discovered by the scientists who removed the flesh and muscles from the human body and found the ideal position.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "Her heels are in the same vertical plane as the ischium.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "Her sides form two straight lines.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "She squats slightly and bends her knees, with the tip of the knee pointing to the direction of the middle finger.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "So as to protect the meniscus.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "In fact, when we move, it is less likely to hurt our body by squatting with our knees bending forwards than bending inwards.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "Ok, let\u2019s move to the side part.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "After the support, we'll talk about weightlessness.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "This is an interesting part.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "Suppose a point supports all the weight and it suddenly goes out of balance.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "What kind of physical phenomenon will happen then?", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "As you can see, her whole body will collapse and sink deep.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "But there will be a linear clue, which goes all the way from the knee to the caudal vertebra to the top of the head, passed down one by one.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "What if the knees become weightless?", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "Do you notice that?", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "The push I gave her leads to the collapse of the entire body, and the weight falls gradually to the ground.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "And what if the whole body experiences weightlessness and falls down straight like a chopstick?", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "She will draw on the inertia of the next moment to regain her balance.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "What if she falls at an angle?", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "You may think she hurts a lot when her falls, but this is not the case.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "As the body falls, the force is transmitted from one part to the other, forming a linear connection, and it is offset in the process.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "This is the swith between support and gravity loss in the study of weightlessness.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "The next thing is the rebound.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "What if the dancer draws on the push to pull herself back up?", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "That is to come back with a force.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "The body, just like a ball, is elastic.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "When I throw it out, it falls on the ground and bounces back.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "Then there's the inertia, the inertia of a force.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "Drawing on the inertia, the body pulls itself up.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "It takes advantage of the inertia in the process.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "There's the inertia in the process.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "Which is the continuous process of passing the force from one part to another.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "Just look how the inertia is produced by rebounding, connecting, and weightlessness.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "It's done.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "There's a lot of weightlessness in the process.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "In the transformation from being supported to

talk about."}{"translation": "A daily routine in our rehearsal hall is to discover the mechanics potentials of our physical body.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "We connect our movements to form a circle.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "The circle forms a non-stop cycle, a connection of the support, the weightlessness, the rebound, and the inertia.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "This is an endless process of remodeling and transforming.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "Let\u2019s look at the entire process.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "She stands on the ground, pull up, falls to the ground, hangs in the air, and bounces back, and after many connections she forms a circle.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "Well, she can keep dancing, as long as she has the strength.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "She can keep looking for the inertia and her sense of coordination, she keeps sensing the space with her body.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "She dances into one circle after another.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "And this brings us to a more difficult movement associated with lying.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "Ok, let's talk about lying now.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "While standing puts the pressure on the feet.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "Lying draws on the support of the whole body.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "Her shoulders, elbows, and hands are here to support the head, and her entire body spreads out like a piece of paper on the ground.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "Every torso, joint, hip bone, side rib, and the spine, the head, and even her fingers can feel the weight of her entire body.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "As she breathes, she will consciously move the weight to the lower part of her body.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "And feel the weight exerted on the torso of the body and the ground.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "So once the body touches the ground, the space will become more diverse.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "It's the support of the entire body.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "If the body is supported by four points, the support will be rather stable in the process.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "What if it is supported by three points?", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "To keep the balance on the ground, there must be at least three force bearing points.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "The body will lose gravity if there are only two points.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "In that case, there will be a rebound.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "The body rebounds, and falls to the ground.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "And with the inertia of the rebound, it falls to the ground, and rebounds again.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "All her strength is controlled by an invisible line.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "Standing back on the ground is more a result of the rebound.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "But lying on the ground keeps your body closer to the ground and the magnetic field itself.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "And makes the support points more diverse.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "It is three-dimensional, and though constantly repetition, becomes four-dimensional.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "This way, we can feel every moment and every body part.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "Let's return to the topic of ground.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "Let's take a look at the coherent movements on the ground.",

about."}{"translation": "That is, when the dancer turns, he or she can't see anything but glittering flashes like on a roller coaster.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "So the dancer must be very clear about her standpoint during her turning.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "And about the point she need

inch of the body can be connected.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "And in that process, even your hair is cylinder-like.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "And the flowing process creates an eternal movement, the flow of consciousness.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "It is important to \"draw circles with imaginary pens\" when the dancer dances in circles.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "Oh, let's have a quick interaction.", "prediction":

to be a complete circle.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "It can be an irregular one.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "After that, we can slowly switch to the left earlobe.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "With the earlobe, we can draw the circle clock-wise and counterclockwise.",

"That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "All your body parts can be a pen.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "It can be your nose or lips.",

talk about."}{"translation": "And then you try to look for the lost part, think about it, and then transform it by creating an infinite circle.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "The infinite circle.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "That infinity comes from the support of our spine.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "The spine is our axis and it allows us to stand and walk.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "What\u2019s more, it seems to bestow dignity on us and equips us with the ability to look far away and support ourselves.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "But the spine can be further developed in our movements.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "Because we have a limited vision and listening ability.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "We stand facing a flat world.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "But with the spinning, twisting, folding, opening and closing of our spine, the space of our body can be developed and twisted.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "And our vision is broadened as our body can be folded and turned.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "The spine also gives a spatial sense to our hands, feet and hips.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "The connection of the spine allows us to produce endless movements across all points, lines, and planes of our body.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "Like an electrocardiogram, every part of your body can bend in powerful waves.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "It is a romantic but hard to do it.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "You have to connect every part of your body.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "Even with the ground, and even to the point of your entire body is turning on the ground.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "The essence of our circular movement system that we've being exploring is the peaceful co-existence of all things.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "We have the seven senses: eyes, ears, mouth, nose, body, mind, time.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "These represent our physical world and our spiritual world.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "We have the ability to see, hear, and smell.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "From the linguistic expression, breathing, physical touch, to the establishment of our consciousness, imagination, and thinking.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "Our body finally becomes the time itself and time becomes the expression of the body.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "Since all things co-exist peacefully, I can see you and you can see me.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "You can hear my voice and I can feel your breath.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "Dance connects all this together.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "Dance becomes a form of connection that allows dancers to observe themselves and connect with the world.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "So next, let's welcome our dancer Huang Li back to our stage.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "She will perform a dance in a circular way.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "Starting from spinning, then performing on the ground and standing up.", "prediction": "That's what I'd

years.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "She also performs in one of the videos I just showed.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "Well, her body is not a typical woman's body, rolling over, and seems very androgynous.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "We don't distinguish between women and men in our theater.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "In fact, androgyny is the most powerful characteristic.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "Being androgynous means that one can be both powerful and soft.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "This is the plasticity of the body.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "A brief moment is eternal.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "Dance is the art of pity.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "Every moment is about to slip sway and can never be recovered, leaving endless pities and regrets.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "So I have been telling dancers not to be obsessed with the moment on stage.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "On stage, they are overwhelmed by your attention and applause.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "But when the curtain falls, they retreat into loneliness and endless emptiness.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "So we have to feel the concentration at every moment, the connection between us, and the relationship between us and the world.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "No matter where we perform on stage, we're not alone.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "All coexists.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "We will be filled with the consciousness of co-existence.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "The integration of different kinds of consciousness becomes a momentary integrity.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "And this integrity gradually grows to be eternal, a disappearing eternity.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "The momentary body movements are the sculpture of the moment.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "In the process.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "Our life is the superficial representation, and it cannot be recovered, so it is finite.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "But our life is also infinite in the sense that we will bring back that lost moment at next moment.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "It proliferates as it slips away.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "Our energy, our thinking and our possibilities of movements are infinite.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "Every moment of movement becomes part of your body, and a sculpture.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "It is a sculpture of the process.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "Each moment can be a photo.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "And each process or each movement will become a texture.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "In making the sculpture, the time unfolds itself.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "And our body becomes the materialization and a measure of time.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "Our body represents time.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "We have different speeds in breaths, heartbeats, and stomach squirming, but that's the magic of nature.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "It ensures a balance of time in the body.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "The degree and speed of our movement are an expression of time.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "And time is not confined to the clock we see.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "It is much more flexible.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "Because each living body has its own sense of time.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "And the process of time becomes a complete expression.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "Because dance is not a point, a line or a plane.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "It is an ongoing and non-stop process.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "As long as you're still alive and the world still exists, your breathing will still be there, and the whole process is the expression of time.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "So I often stress that the expression of dance should not focus on a certain moment.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "But on the connection, or the process.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "In our years of exploration.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "I come to feel the ultimate power of passing the baton of dancing to future generations.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "I want to share a little story.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "The Tao Theater was co-founded by me, Duan Ni, and Wang Hao.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "At the initial stage, only three of us struggled to perform our work on stage.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "But as we become older and our body grows weak.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "We are gradually drifting away from the stage.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "So whenever we see dancers still expressing themselves purely, clearly and attentively on the stage.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "The three of us will be moved to tears.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "Because I feel these emerging artists have played an increasingly important part in performing dance on stage.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "It is a kind of spirit, an emotion, a resonance of our spiritual world.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "This is a continuation.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "And dance is not about individuals.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "It is about the relationship between people.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "It is about people and life.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "Because rather than rendering people lonely, dance connects the whole world together.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "Making people feel the connection with other people, and it allows people to integrate with nature through observations.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "Loneliness may be the ultimate fear of human beings.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "We fear loneliness just as we fear death.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "It seems that after death, we will have nothing but the word \"lonely\".", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "Dancers incorporate dance into part of their daily life.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "They strike a chord with other dancers or people by watching and imitating their dances and by dancing to retain the moment.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "Our next plan is a nomadic plan that grows out of our long-term performance tour.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "This plan follows the lifestyle of the nomads.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "We bring dances and perform them in different cities and spaces in China.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "It doesn't have to be a theater.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "It could be a school or any public space.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "Such as the art gallery, as long as we can communicate like this on the scene.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "We can see the sweat, and feel the breath.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "We can see or hear it in its most original form.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "And let people connect with each other on the spot.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "And the connection itself is the benefit of dance.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "It can connect the world.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "It can also relieve people's loneliness on the spot.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "And then in different scenes,

I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "Even if the last second has passed.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "We can retain it the next second by constantly repeating the movement to achieve eternity.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "That's all I want to share with you today.", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "Thank you!", "prediction": "That's what I'd like to talk about."}{"translation": "I want to invite dancer Huang Li to come on stage and say goodbye to everyone.",
