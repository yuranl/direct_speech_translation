<seg id=1>good afternoon everyoneOur current Internet technology is quite developedThrough WeChat, we can easily send a joke to our relatives and friends, send a picture, send a videoEven if we use 10 of his institutions in one minute,But there are also things that are difficult to postFor example, if you send $10 to a friend who comes to the U.S., it will be difficult for you to try it.This is because assets like the dollar bill shop cannot be copied, and their peer-to-peer delivery requires trust.Trust how we solve it in real lifeIn actual life, we often rely on intermediary agencies such as government banksThere is such an important intermediary organization, they constitute the credit foundation of our societyMany times their work is very goodSo we call them a universal intermediaryBut there seem to be many problems in lifeThe cross-border remittance that Liu just mentionedHe is not only efficient and low-cost, but also very highToday we buy a house. Tomorrow a lot of big brothers and sisters will care about how to decorate your house.Obviously leakedAt the best time, I didn’t say that this is the middle of all evilIs it possible for us to use technology to optimize the body is to reconstruct the trust foundation of this society?In 2008, a hacker named Satoshi Nakamoto released a peer-to-peer electronic payment systemAfter the system went online, it has been favored by many hacker organizations, money laundering organizations, and other gray organizations.This system is the Bitcoin systemBitcoin has also risen 3 million times in this eight yearsOf course there is a lot of speculation in itBut it is undeniable that Bitcoin has its core priceLet’s take a look at the difference between Bitcoin transfer and bank transfer.The bank transfer on the left is familiar to all of usIt relies on the bank as an intermediary institution to maintain creditSimultaneous device relies on the bank to help him keep accountsIt’s easier to add one to the downloaded account minus one from the accountThis bitcoin transfer on the rightIt looks more complicated, let me give you a brief introductionCompared to when making a bitcoin transferThis transaction Bitcoin system uses P2P network technology to transmit to all Bitcoin network nodesAll network nodes will use a common algorithm to verify whether the transaction is validAt the same time, the verification result is transmitted to all other nodes through P2P network technology.I want everyone to book together based on the results of this verificationIt is based on the algorithm to reach a consensus to generate creditIt relies on the network to keep accountsEvery node on the network keeps accounts togetherThe biggest differenceYou will find that there is no need for intermediary agencies anymoreThis is why many financial institutions will study this technology in the past two years because this technology may bring about a disruptive effect.This technology is what we are talking about blockchain technologyIt mainly contains five categories of technologyThe P2P network technology mentioned just now also has consensus algorithm technology, peptide chain structure technology, and smart and smoke password shoes.These five technologies are not actually new technologies. They existed many years ago.But they combine to form a magical chemical reaction that can create trustThis is like the magical iPhone created by Jobs 10 years ago by adding a mobile phone, an iPad, and a browser.We have been working as a third-party payment system for so many yearsWe combine more than ten years of technology accumulation with the technical concepts of blockchain and the characteristics of the information systems of many enterprises in our reality to re-innovate a new set of blockchain systems.A database-based blockchain system we call it trust coWe think that the chess block chain technology belongs to the basic connection technology at the bottom of the foundation.We mentioned a lot of intermediary issues. If we combine the reliable technical capabilities of the blockchain technology1G develops practical application solutions for specific problemsIn the future, we will use these basic application solutions to optimize and even solve the problem of mutual trust between our institutions and even enterprises.Then it will make the collaboration between our institutions more credible, more efficient, and cheaperSo as to achieve true value maximizationSo how do we use this technology?Before we mentioned the blockchain, many people thought of Bitcoin and even some people thought it was Jin YongToday we are talking about something differentLike our relatives are lostCan we find him fasterWe all know that there are many public welfare administrative agenciesBut we don’t know that this is the data security issue of the information entered by the agency because of the verification of the information, the issue of data attribution, and the issue of privacy protection, etc.Cause these institutions are actually not so revivedThis makes their rooted institution actually a highly encouraged information islandWhat&#39;s the problemone exampleWhen our child is lostWhen routing information from the first node to the second node, there is confidence. This usually takes several hours.In the processIt is possible that the child is walking through the broadcast of the second node 71I might have found it and went home for dinner.But in fact, they don’t know this informationHe is still looking for people everywhere, causing a lot of waste of resourcesApril of this yearWe have a 404 when our baby goes homeUsing xcode&#39;s shared ledger solution to create a charity tracing exerciseHe can do 1.6 into the front chain universalCan effectively avoid the question of information islandsMake newcomers more efficient and more efficient and transparentMail is best to happen to meHalf a month agoOne of my high school classmatesI was anxious to find me and said their old man was lostThe toy that day was the afternoon of August 14thThat night, we helped him complete the verification of the information and entered itNoon on the 2nd dayMy classmate told me very happilyThe old man in his family found it back and he didn&#39;t expect that he could find it back so soonAt that time, we actually didn’t expect to be able to get it back so quicklyWe go and 10 whenI found that the old man was retrieved through the WeChat Moments advertisementIn other words, when we finished entering the information that night, we went home from the baby 66In the future, this information was immediately obtained from the information node of WeChat and broadcasted using WeChat Moments advertisements.Someone saw this ad and found this old manSo we got the old man back in a very fast timeAlthough this is a case of a small pedestrian, we also deeply found that it embodies the charm of blockchain technology.He can actually make the value of our society become more shallow and warmThis is a small caseActually we can think of something biggerThere is a very famous social topic about how to prove that your mother is your mother.Said he answered the sensationAt that time, I said that when we did other things, we thought of the fact that we were born to grow old.We have been facing this problem. We are proving our existence, proving our growth, proving our ability.whyBecause we have been applying for the certificate, the student ID, the birth certificate and then the real estate certificateAt the same time, in the process of applying for the certificate, we also found that we spent a lot of time and a lot of money and a lot of trouble.If we can use the application solution of the blockchain to witness the certificate, we can load the data behind the certificate on a digital identity chain to achieve true alignment.In the future, we only need a fingerprint to authorize the dispatch of this data to make our own personal proof.Is it true that in the future society, he won’t reappear the question of how to prove that your mother is your mother’s egg?In addition, I don’t know if you have ever thought about what will happen to him if we really have no cash for the societyIn the first half of the year, a TV series was very popular in the name of the peopleThere is a taste in it, the director was arrested as soon as he opened, and he was 100 million yuanWhen I saw this place, I was thinkingifWe can digitize various farmland assets such as cash for the society, and it can be placed in the blockchainUsing the non-tamperable and traceable ability of the blockchain, can our millennia of anti-corruption problem be effectively controlled?Just now we talked about a few cases, that means there are three ideasWe will find that our future world has another possibility because of the blockchainJust like the blockchain technology used by bacteria optimizes the credit foundation of our societyIt’s like we used wood and stone to build a house beforeWe are now building the house with reinforced concreteBlockchain technology is what we need to find reinforced concreteIt can make our future relationships between people and institutions and institutions and even between countries and countries become more harmonious. Old stories can make their collaboration more efficient and transparent, and create greater value for society.As long as we dare to break through our thinking, dare to try, we have a politically warm heart in our heartsThen we can also use this technology to emit a dazzling lightthank you all</seg>
<seg id=2>Good evening, everybodyToday we are going to talk about why anti-gene technology should not beTopic is a very hot topicIf you payPlease cooperate with me and let us make a small choiceWe now have two different15 One is genetically modified food and the other is biotechnology food or foodOkay, friends who are willing to choose genetically modified foods to cancel their handsOkay, I don’t seem to see a few walkingFriends who are curious about our willingness to choose biotech food, raise their handsOk i saw everything hand okIn fact, genetically modified food and biotech food are the sameAre all made with the same technologySo from this friendWe must not blindly oppose genetic modificationOnce upon a time, some people thought that genetically modified food was a conspiracy made by the Americans. After eating genetically modified food, then he would gradually lose the ability to reproduce, and then the Chinese human architecture would be wiped out.This is a conspiracy theoryAfter the conversion, think about it, it’s not like thatActually in the United States in a country like the United States, right? Their people are genetically modifiedThere are more than 2,000 different genetically modified foods on the market and there is no mandatory label in the United States.So the people don’t know what they’re sayingSo i thoughtAmericans should be the first group of people to use genetic modification because the United States was the first to produce it.So if that&#39;s the case, will Americans be infertile?Obviously not like thatBecause someone once said that in order to oppose this American using genetically modified foods to destroy Chinese dragon breeds. Because I am a descendant of the dragon, I have to protect the general election certificate for each movement.Just the oppositeThen again, in January of this year, the U.S. approved the genetically modified insect-resistant rice that China has not seen in China.Because what do you doChina&#39;s genetically modified insect-resistant rice can be practically sold in the United States from now onThe so-called conspiracy theory is self-defeating by thisBecause the Americans themselves also introduced genetically modified rice from China for useSo what I said is ridiculous and ridiculous now when I think about itWhyUse another example to illustrateI don’t think any of our viewers don’t like high-speed rail, right?High-speed rail is the pride of ChinaNo one goes far and doesn’t want to take the high-speed rail.But do you know that it was the same when the train first entered China more than 100 years agoSee there is a picture here, rightA group of people said that the train destroyed China’s dragon veinsIf yes, it set off a strong movement of the Baolong line of the Pakistan Railway, right?Let&#39;s think about how ridiculous it is to sell Railway BaoluMaybe another 20 yearsIt’s also ridiculous that we reverse QibaolongSo i thoughtWe shouldn&#39;t do such a ridiculous thingMaybe we think about what a turnaround isFirst of all, I want to introduce a concept what is *Today it is a piece of ribonucleic acid with genetic function. This fragment is the simplest explanation.What is a turnaround?What is a turnaround?Actually genetically modifiedWe can understand it as a technology or as a processTherefore, let&#39;s make it simplerIn other words, the technique of transferring genes from one species to another is called a legend.Or to sayGenes in one species are transferred to another species through a certain mediumThis is also the process of genetic modification. So one is the process and the other is the technology.Opposition to success or against technologyThen of course, he needs a certain medium to transfer into it. We said that it can only be made through natural hybridization.Seeing that this naturally occurring hybrid produced a lot of new thingsHumans have learned to perform artificial hybridizationWe can also turn for the better if we use modern biotechnologyThe process of turning around is getting this climaxWe look at it from a technical point of viewIn fact, we can also consider the processA turnaround process can actually occur between different individuals of the same speciesOccurs between individuals of different speciesTransition is a process of gene transfer. Of course, it needs a kind of gene transfer.Several photography enthusiasts like to take picturesI often go to nature, I see which different insects are there, right? They come to carry out this medium as a medium to transfer genes between different substances or different flowersThe most recent is the situation of natural turning eyesNow everyone can see the picture below. This is also one of the legendary things that God is doing.We have a purple corn on the cob. This kind of corn is also planted with a white corn on the cob.Think about it, if the pollen of this purple corn floats on top of this white corn with the windWhat color corn cobs will they produceThink about itBlack and white, everyone said it wellThen everyone take a lookProduced such corn on the cobObviously he is different from before and its changes are more abundant, right?So the genetic modification process is a creation of moviesLet our kind of home have more choice price opportunitiesThis is the natural turning point we are talking aboutIn order to obtain more such genetic variation, YongjiaIt is convenient for us to select the best ones for breeding to form good varietiesYou said to improve his bottle, feel his impact resistance, improve his disease resistance, etc.In the process of mutation, we can also use color lines to compileSay you see that we saw you paint space breeding like thisSend the rocket carried by our seeds to space to let the rays come from and then it will produce pictures, which can produce mutationsAnd we can also fuse different cells together and let them produce the so-called cell hybridization, which can also produce changes.But if these mutations are like this kind of process, they are all random. It takes a long time to complete a job.So the turnaround we are talking about today or the short-term most discussed by the public is actually the use of biotechnology to transfer opportunities in Beijing.TechnologyWe can cultivate cotton that has been transformed into papaya seeds and refined.So in fact, let’s take a look at this transition process.Just now we talked about God, he is a crossbreed, so now we say God is too blindHuman-dog hybrids are also busySo if we want him to be very specific and precise, how do we do what we want?Then we first find a car like this we call intelligence, right?Then for this intelligence, you can cut it through a small cut and lead him to this position with the fragment we need.Thinking of one of our taxis, let me get in a taxi and put it in a bureauThen he can transcribe a lot of copies that can be reproducedThen he can go to contact the genetically modified cell that we need to transferThen in the process, he can see the intellectual gene, which he can release from the cell, and if it is new, he can transfer to the cell and avoid fusion with the chromosomal gene in the chromosome of our cell.Cultivated into a different white jade merchant organizationThen the budget is organized and after training, he grows into a small seedling. This small seedling grows into a big temple after being cultivated in Jin.So in this kind of seedling, he contains the transit brigade, so let&#39;s make the transit prohibition.If you look at this inventory, it is consistent with our traditional goalBut it is faster, more precise and more efficientLet&#39;s take a lookWhy we shouldn&#39;t take a turn for the betterThen everyone knows that ensuring that people all over the world have food to eat is a very, very serious task. This kind of task allows everyone to eat and eat.So everyone look at this curveThis curve of the city represents a trend of population growthAnd the blue dotted line at the back shows two possibilities for two productionsIf we use the happy technology, right? We can make good use of the land, then the food may come from the upper route.Can just meet the needs of people&#39;s growthBut if we don’t use thisIt’s impossible that our food will blow a huge gap. Once a gap appears, then there will actually be a problem.Think about it everyoneAs long as the rice with Chinese characters is composed of two partsWhat is a part calledTeacher rightWhat is itIf food security cannot be guaranteedIt will cause turmoil in this societyThen population growth is a very, very big problem, which puts huge pressure on our food guaranteeThen there is something to say about the process of urbanizationThis process of infrastructure construction also occupies a lot of landLet’s take a look. Here is a photo. It was taken in a certain place in Shanghai 30 years ago.Can everyone recognize where this is?But 20 years later, we took the same group of photos in the same place.Do you knowThis is a photo 20 years laterDo we knowIt seems that everyone knows it, right? It’s normal, right? It’s in Pudong.Who said that? We can see that many places in the previous two days have become roads and cities.As each urbanization process takes up a lot of landOur country hopes to save 1,800,000,000 such a landBut so far it’s very, very difficultActually we still face many problemsFor example, our resources are constantly valuing, our global climate is volatileYou see, we are like our Shanghai on the beach, we have a lot of water around us, but maybe everyone knows that Shanghai is an area lacking drinking water, right?With these voluntary rules, there are a lot of problemsThe other thing is that we want to increase the production of food to ensure that everyone has food to eatthen what should we doIf we increase production, can we expand the area of arable land?It must be impossible to download in China.So do we do this? We give him more glory and turn it all into fertilizerWould you like to do thisThen go to your bowlRightThis road can&#39;t be found in ChinaThe already thick farmland ecological environment has been greatly damagedThen the only thing we can do is to use very rich genetic resources and combine our new biotechnology including our genetically modified technology.Only then can we transfer to Pakistan at a high-speed, accurate, and efficient price to produce more of this grainI just mentioned that China sprays 2 million tons of pesticides into our farmland every year.Think about 2 million degrees of pesticides, right?Now we can use alternative technology we can use genetically modified insect-resistant riceYou can see that the long distance is the short-term resistance to the green and secluded waterways, right?And the normal riceIn the case of pesticides, you can see that the difference between them is very, very bigSo what we can say is that we traditionally hope to transfer a useful case that white ball to a better variety to avoid the goal achieved by traditional methods.The market is less accurateWe use the current method as the purpose of a great retrogression in historyYou can see that we can be more efficient and accurate, and there is also such a method that will be related to this reproductive disorder to achieve the purpose of genetic modification, right?You said that we want to transfer the gene from the one who raised such a drought-resistant and the one who raised him to the waterway. Obviously, the method we have noticed cannot be crossed.But if we have biotechnology and then switch to technology, we can easily achieve this goal, right?So this turnaround is indeed a very good price tagBut maybe our friends will ask you to say that this transfer is so good. Does it have any other problems?It’s true that he may still have some problems when making a turn for a new technology.Then I don’t want to solve theseEveryone who exists first thinks that we think that food is our heaven.Whether he has food or not depends on the food safety issue, right? Will he have any problems after eating?Then what impact will it have on the environment?OtherwiseThen there are some other things like whether we should label our transit videos so that the people have the right to know and choose.Is the country’s laws and regulations to do these things, etc. There are many choicesIn our country, there are very complete regulations to control this matterAnd in other words, when we transfer any genetically modified gene into the production process, he must strictly carry out this safety evaluation. Only after it is safe, he can sell it before it can be commercialized.Therefore,International agencies believe that it is safe to transfer genetically modified food into productsThe two international organizations of the United Nations also believe that software products are safe and the other is legal.All text messages from all over the world are carried out under this framework.Now let’s take a look at the legend about why genetic modification can’t be reversed.Now, as Chinese, why shouldn’t we come to reverse the gene even more? Let’s take a look togetherThis edible genetically modified food has been caught in the world for nearly 20 yearsIn this processIn the short term, the area of such a neutron is expanding very rapidly, right? Now it has reached more than 1.8 hectares. Let me calculate that it is about 2.7 or 2.8 billion acres of each area.The green line above the green line indicates the overall planting area of the city transitIf the line is red and blue, it shows that the area is in developed countriesAt the same time this line is developing countriesDeveloping countries have already surpassed this planting area in developed countriesBut under such an increasing price situation that the whole world looks like, our situation in China isYou see, from 2002, we ranked 4th, right? Later, we ranked 5th and 6th. Now we are ranked to the bottom, right?This is very dissatisfied with our country’s statusThere is a set of data, everyone can come and have a lookIn 2001, China ranked 4th. We have the United States, Canada and Argentina ahead of us.But since 2003, Brazil surpassed us. Then in 2007, India surpassed us, so we ranked 6th.What a pityIndia used to be an importer of cottonHe has become an exporter of cotton when he uses this technology, right?Well, China is already much smaller than him in this number.And why are there many small countries catching up with China in the 6th place after many years?So by the year 2600, China immediately ranked 8th. Last year, the Bar of Paraguay Paraguay and Pakistan surpassed us.I&#39;m thinking about what kind of country it will be, closely following China for about 10 yearsParaguay is a very small country with only over 6 million peopleA country with 1.4 billion people and a country with 6 million peopleSuch a difference between them, this image is very worthy, is it dissatisfied with the status of our country in all aspectsOnce we sayIf you don&#39;t advance, you will retreatBecause genetic modification is a technology that makes money, genetic modification is also a technological highlandIf we do not occupy, other countries will definitely standWhen we are still arguing about whether to develop and change usageMany countries have quietly surpassed usI think this phenomenon is very, very seriousAnd food security is also a very important issueOur country now imports 11 tons of grain every yearA ton of grainWhat is this conceptI calculated that every person would import 70 kilograms of grain from you, China, and every person in China.What dayThen we will have a relatively big price problemIt&#39;s not that we don&#39;t developI will definitely lose such an opportunitySo when we think back to China’s genetically modified production, we have had a glorious period.The success of genetically modified cotton is not only about saving China’s cotton industryAnd it makes the whole world feel very impressiveThink about the past when our Zhuanji papaya hadn&#39;t been on the market, farmers had no choice but to face the harm of the virus.But today we see them carrying the anti-virus in a few years, and the efficiency of China&#39;s harvest harvestIt’s because we feel how creative this technology is and how it brings us happinessTherefore, I want to hope that our technology can make our lives betterThanks everyone</seg>
<seg id=3>Is from Hong Kong in EnglishCan you give me some applause and encouragementThis is also my informationBecause if I don’t speak well at the conference,At the very least, the organizer has won some longevity, which is convenient for people to introduce later.The title of the content I want to share with you today is Operation SystemIt’s actually my experience in the music scene over the past 32 years.I also want to share with you some of the county’s creationsThe annual meeting is divided into four partsThe first part is the creative roadIt’s what I’ve been doing since 1985 and I want to tell everyone who I amThe second part is about my personal artistic creations in addition to music creation, including photography, painting, etc.Part of it is some creative methods that I often use and I also hope to share with youFinally, it is also an attitude of slow life creationMaybe these partsLet everyone watch for a few more secondsBecause I have been in the industry for 32 yearsToday, some people in Meiji still think I’m a womanThat&#39;s why I&#39;m putting it onPart of the creative ideasI am a lucky personIn 1984, in 1985, I had your Huang Yangming with two friends. At that time, the two of them were about to form a male music group.However, I wrote some lyrics to them in the same incidentLet&#39;s pass about one or two yearsMade a lot of samples and sent them to all the big and small product companiesSoon they also received a new contract from that patent company to become its artistAnd renamed the Daming SchoolThen Daming 1’s genre lyrics MVThe listing of modeling cases brought some impact to the orchestra at that time because they were relatively advancedI am also very lucky for this reasonSoon I received the attention of many senior singersAt that time, Alan Tam, Leslie Cheung, Anita Mui, Jacky Cheung, would soon ask me to write lyrics for themThen the following 10 years, 15 years and 20 yearsI wrote about two to three thousand lyrics on the Hong Kong sideGradually, the lyricist became the producer of the concert, and the planning also included the production of the album of the song, etc.Until 2005, there was an inflection point or a turning point in my career. What is it?Did the music take off at the time?Many people came to Beijing and Shanghai to do some music projects for meAt that time, I frankly said that there was a little imbalance in my heartwhatBut I searched Baidu’s music chartsIn the top 100 Cantonese songs probably only accounted for 10 starters, maybe even lessSometimes I don’t have my work for a month, two months, and a half yearAsk me to search the top 500 classic songsSome of my works are probably those classic Cantonese songs from the 80s and 90sI was thinking about whether I should be in the supplier marketThis fish market that I am totally unfamiliar with15 to 40 years old to start again, it seems too old to retire, it seems too earlySo I didn’t give up afterwards.I transferred to the public facilities that I established in Beijing in 2006It’s also lucky that I participated in some large-scale craft songs, including some songs from the 2008 Olympic Games and the 2010 World Expo.Then I was lucky. In 2008, I created the theme song Huaxi for the film Painted Skin.You get a lot of attention, awards, etc.In the 10 years from 2008 to that time of this year, I have done a lot of cases in my studio outside of the song.Some even have nothing to do with musicEven the performance of the illusion demonstration of the advertising endorsement is bad for shooting the MVHaodeng Disney has a lot of cooperationThe opening of their park in 2016 was the theme song of Disneyland Shanghai, which I created in collaboration with Teacher Tan Dun.But in such a variety of music projects, I have a soft spot for a way of acting that is actually a musical.In 1997, I acted as a screenwriter for the musical Xuelanghu performed by Jacky Cheung. There were about a quarter of the lyrics and a song written.Then last year 2014 was the 20th anniversary of the election andJia Wei also helped an excellent Hong Kong cartoonist, Ma Rongcheng, to work on the lyrics of the entire play, the classic online musical Fengyun musical.I believe everyone has seen Fengyun&#39;s movieThe production last year made me realize many new technologiesPlaying water pressure on the stage and many, many new projections, where is the new form of productionAt the end of this year, I should be co-developing my first musical with the Shanghai Wenguang Performing Arts Group. The name of my personal musical is Ai Zai Xinguangli.Starlight means a punThis is a neighborhood that looks like an alleyThen, why do I have a soft spot for music among all kinds of music performances?The reason for this can be explained in the next part 2.Crossover artSince I was born, I think I have a kind of natural ability. Is it because I see some pictures and see stories? I can easily convert it into simple words.Then when I was 10 years oldI can now turn the original text into lyricsIn my junior high schoolI often change some English songs into Chinese songs and comprehend the lyrics of many different themes.Then I went to the graphic design of the junior college I studied after graduating from high school.Finally, I will slowly convert this ability into a photographer or even painting, and even later I like to force the model to be a three-dimensional thing.It’s not that I see many different experiences in life that make me like to turn it into a creative workIt’s just some photos I took with filmThe most unlucky thing is to cooperate with meThat time I recorded with them or filmed commercialsIn fact, besides telling them whether I want to be formal at the scene, I actually like to let him let them be my models and let me take pictures.I don&#39;t care if they like it or notYou should know how you feel when you look at their helpless eyesBut they respect it and don’t know that I like it the most convenient in lifepaintingI really like a way of expression that I like very much.I think the use of black and white images can give him some very clean emotions in my heart, a kind of magic that settles down very stably.And the ones you saw above are all tasks I often give myselfThis is when I’m flying, if it’s a very short flight, about two or three hours, I’m sure to make the soil luxurious.So when I saw 59 repairing some magazines and aviation magazines, I just drew it in two or two hours.But the one at the bottom left is looking for Li Jiaxing, that is what I said is a fineFine sketchIt’s almost all the time, that is, each one is used for 100 hoursAnd every day, two or three hoursGo home and spend a few hoursThen it takes one month, two months or even half a year to completeThese texture pressures are also traced according to the hair.Through this process, I am able to talk to my own sexual desires. I think it gives me more time to conceive and all works.This is because art is connected, the number of ants is the sameMany people have asked me how it is the sameThen I will introduce the three parts of 156 introductionAre some of the creative methods I often useImbalance, asymmetry, contrast and sublimation are some of the techniques I often useOne is very simpleIt is unbalanced asymmetry from the imbalance on the screen, such as the size of the object before and afterThe one in the upper right cornerOdd and odd people face many thousands of passersbyThis kind of asymmetry and unbalance on the pictureThe other is contrast. Contrast is the contrast of colors.Early in the morningOne after anotherThat is, the contrast between black and white and redThe number in the lower left corner is also a color contrastI want to mention that there is a sentence on the soda can that I created myselfYou can&#39;t seeThis is love what is your heartLook at the word 20If the last letter H is brought to the front, it becomes HiThis is a closing point I came up withChinaThen many people say that art is a kind of sublimation extracted from life12 What is life?What I want to share is because I see something very often and feel very uncharacteristic. Do you have the ability to see something different?I like modified modelsPut some normal and ordinary things to turn it into extraordinary thingsFor example, this Polaroid camera, me, I saw his look, I thought it was very interesting, then I saw that I could change it into somethingThen I will buy it back, take it apart and paint it with colors to turn it into a spaceship and add some parts that people will continue to paint.Then I also criticized the map to help him become something like a posterThen the most important thing is to download and go back to the original point. You can still take pictures.It&#39;s still a normal PolaroidThis is also a kind of inspiration in life and a kind of sublimationThis is the draft I have madeSleep for a long timeInquired about some models that have been collected slowly, but there is no time to make themI have always wanted to change the volume for your car and convert it into that helicopterI have a friend who is a parent he studiedHe asked me one day and saidXiaoqi, you don’t have so much interest in creating moreThen how do you think it is possible to cultivate his children to have some more focused, some literacy and some interestsThen I ask him a questionI ask you besides buying him the latest mobile phones and the latest computer notebooks. Did you train him to have some works that take a long time to complete? Things are tasks, for example, one month, six months, and more than one year.Looking at me quietly means that there is noThen I said you hurry up and do itBecause now the new media high-tech AIIf you want children to look at this era, look different from others in this eraThen you should give him some more mobile phones and laptops. At the same time, he will also train him some works and tasks that need to be painted well for a long, long time to complete.Because there are fewer and fewer people who can do this kind of thingThis is the first kind of artistic sublimation that I told himDiao kind of sublimation isToo much informationTomorrow, we will turn on the phone, watch WeChat, and open Weibo. Many good things, bad things are related to us, things are not closed, we can accept everything and it’s easy to acceptSo I give him one thing that is to try my best to upgrade his judgment and aesthetic standards.What is itThis is for us not to take time to criticize some bad things and to take time to wipe some people we don’t knowConversely, we will only spend time to appreciate the things that we think are good, and time to praise the works that we think are goodThis will make your own aesthetic standards more pureAs part of it I want to share is to live hard and slowIs a popular term called slow fire?A lot of contacts and connections represent a very loose lifeIt’s sold for three hours after making it in coffee. Actually, it’s not in my shop.Slow fire actually requires a lot of hard workYou just saw the creation of many works I didSo I am a little bit biggerEven if I am interested in playing something, I am also a very hardworkingBecause you don’t just spend hundreds of hours talking and swear words and then use a combination modelBesides, family is related to making moneyI want to share it is the golden age of Hong Kong music sceneA group of creators in Weifang, they are also very diligent Leslie Cheung and Anita Mui before the conferenceI won&#39;t talk about it todayYou probably have all heard their storiesExplain that he used to be in the amusement parkI just want to practice singing and dancing every dayOnly later can I become a queen on stageIs this my slow life?It’s also the way I use my life to reflect the imbalance and asymmetry that I should talk about before youwhyUntil today, I still listen to black records and it’s very inefficientMusic phones can find thousands of songs and tens of thousands of songs with any appBut I still like to listen to the dark and inefficientI&#39;ll turn over that record in 15 minutesPhoto film photoRefitIt’s very convenient to drive any car, but I still like modified bicyclesFind some parts when learning the weather onlineThis is not expensive at all, it just takes timeThrough the process of this dish, I gradually have a deep feeling for everything I have.There are some things in LeleAll the information in our new media is forgettable in everythingGet quickly and forget quicklySo I just live slowly through it, then I make me cherish the things I can get even moreRecently I also like to make a model of a houseI want to add you in building a railway modelI just want to take the initiative to come out of that small city in JapanThis is also very time consumingIt takes a long time for you to get a moon houseSo I’m looking forward to many artists, singers and cooperators who are recordingI told them that I was very lucky to be able to survive in this circle, a must-have attitudeExcept for the packaging, besides the set of peopleYour attitude towards this kind of attitude in life is a necessary condition for you to be able to go on for a long time.Pop art pop culture has been developed for so many years nowWhat we call creation is actually very difficult to start from scratch, from scratch, that is, to bring the national character carrier out of the invention center&#39;s song will say what the shape will be difficult, difficultCold, don’t talk about eternitySo even long-term diligence is necessaryAs today&#39;s protagonistI want to tell you the story behind each songThis song is about Leslie CheungBecause April is the season to miss Leslie CheungIf Leslie Cheung decided to quit the music scene in 1990Tomorrow night some of us will have dinner at that Chinese restaurant in Hong KongThen when he mentioned people, he just wanted to quit Lele’s orchestraThen I told him that your famous works continue to blow the school spiritThen I want to write a song about windJust let your music fans let you let your fans think of you when the wind blowsWhen this song is called Feng Zaiqi</seg>
<seg id=4>Mom’s imperfection may be seen by all of usThe two of us met in 1984I was a college student at the time and just graduated from the Academy of Fine ArtsThen Apu Na, he just came to the Children’s Palace to learn paintingIt has been 34 years since 80 yearsHe wants this mild mental retardation we callLet’s take a look and compose it now. He has created more than 4,100 works, including more than 2,000 works of costume paintings and classical music.Let&#39;s take a look at Apu nowThen I think 34 years ago when such a special child came to our Shanglin Palace, I didn’t realize at all that after 34 years we would have a special education, an integrated education situation.Maybe I am a teacher in the Children&#39;s Palace who faces special childrenHis parents couldn’t open his eyes when she was born, he couldn’t even suck milk and his body was limp.Then when faced with a child like this, they may really be 10,000. What power can save them?The bottom photo is the one on the left is me and the one on the right is optWe can see a word in such a big sceneHe is painting with a small body like this waving a paintbrushYou can see that he is really a very gifted girlWhen he published his first album of pictures 20 years ago, we set up an experimental class called Featured Children’s Art in Apuna.There are more than 10 of them. We are talking about cerebral palsy, autism, Down syndrome, and so on.Play for free and make some of this kid will be in itWe hope that a case of Ah Pu Qiangzi can inspire more special children to express themselves through artThen, in 2006, when the work in our area was completed last year, we formally established a special education center to provide special services for toilet children.In 10 years, we have the support of Wucai JinThen provide 2,000 public welfare free degrees to the society every yearSo far we have 15,000 free degreesSo we have seen from more than a dozen children now that there are more than 2,000 degrees like this, we are really gratefulBecause of OPPO, we were only a small wish at the time, and we are very grateful for what we are today.Well, we now have more than 60 art education courses, and at the same time, we have sent teachers homeFor example, we have a hospital in Guangzhou, some of which are regular and some things are irregular. In the cancer ward, we have art classes and some have music classes.Then we will have art classes in the orphanage, etc.Then our goal is that we hope that every child can make the best use of their own abilitiesEvery child is uniqueSo that they can be their best selvesThen we had a fusion art troupe in 14 yearsThe introduction of Theron’s art troupe is now showing a video for everyone to watchWe let you go public for another 20 years, and then we went on the road of special education. Now we see that we have many ordinary children. We are still in a very harmonious time and space with the toilet.When I saw this picture, I was really happy and happy in my heart because I really saw this group of children living in harmony.We can watchIn the past few days, I went to the TV station to film some of the programs we released and did some sortingThen I put it on the Apu filmed on the Art Gallery of Guangdong TV 30 years ago. At that time he was about 10 years old.Then he is really addicted to paintingThen he walks normallyThen I turned to a CCTV show about the quantifiers of the Eastern time and space that crossed Pupu nearly 20 years ago.Then he had a serious mental disorder at that timeThen it was a picture album that was on a business tripHer mother was still the same young at that time, and the sound of his cigarette was his tears, talking about his worries and his worries.20 years have passedEminem&#39;s mother is gray-haired nowLooking forward to the operation and the movement is very inconvenient. Various sicknesses make the body of the materialEminem&#39;s experience of the ups and downs in lifeFor example, because he can urinate, he can’t urinate, he needs to use a urinary catheterSo it’s very inconvenient for him to come out every dayThen every year he has to go to the hospital for a Pang Guang plastic surgeryLife is up and down like thisThen it became his normal state for the painter to do rehabilitation operationsThen it’s very inconvenient when traveling because it’s not easy to fightIn fact, all children with mobility impairments, especially those with cerebral palsy, their parents have an experience that children grow up day by day, their children grow up, mothers and fathers are getting old, and they are increasingly unable to hold their children.Then there will be a day when they will never be able to repay their children againAt the same time, this very common experience is that when they are struggling, the taxi drivers will never look at him.But I want to say that their experience will definitely become ourswhyBecause everyone will get old, everyone may have time when sitting in a wheelchairRecently, my parents are over 80 and over 90They all went to the hospital one after anotherI watched them aging, my own body is gradually getting oldThen my legs and feet sometimes have inconveniences, such as other things that hurt and so on.Then I think I can’t guarantee that I won’t be a man in this lifeSo when I get old, maybe one day we will sit in a wheelchair with Apu Quantum or push that intrusive gasNot so much, but we return to the topic of our children’s education and integrated education for 20 yearsActually, I really want to tell these special children and their families and their parents that I am grateful for having youBecause on the surface for 20 years, have we given you a lot? For example, we just saw on the screen how many degrees we have for them every week, and how many resources we have for them, and how they speak out in front of the public? Express one&#39;s own existence, show one&#39;s talents, etc.But what I want to say is that these children gave us the opportunity to regain the love we should have, and love each other and we learn to love our neighbor as ourselvesBecause we seem to be helping them on the surface, in fact we are helping ourselvesTo me, no one can guarantee that they will never sit in a wheelchair on crutchesI do integrated education because I hope that one day I will get old. When I am in a wheelchair, what I have to fight is that I will pass by because I am in a wheelchair. It’s that simpleToday I turned it out and I re-written two paragraphs as the end of my speech today.I still don’t know your name, the sugar baby, it’s nice to have youEvery day when you are little you are weak, you pounce on me, hug me and kiss meThis sudden trust and IE are like a ray of warm sunshine driving away all the haze in my heart that dayAt that moment you are so powerful as to save the whole world lost for the lack of loveAnd the standard of this society often sees you like this. You are just a flawed or even a useless person.It’s nice to have you all the kids in the art troupeEvery day in the hustle and bustle of people, I saw that we talked together. A little secretary pushed his little partner, and a child in a wheelchair passed me hurriedly.This picture is really so beautiful and he is firmly fixed in my heartToday I have you, I have all of us here. Maybe there is only one purpose. It&#39;s mother&#39;s worries about himself and his son&#39;s worries about our worries about our possibility of sitting in a wheelchair one day.Everyone’s similar worries will be a thing of the pastBecause when we love our neighbor as ourselvesWhen we can warm each other and watch each other and love each other, when we become a community of destiny, will such a moment be far away from us?Because in each other&#39;s love, there will be no more worry and no fear anymoreI think this is the greatest significance of integrated educationthank you all</seg>
<seg id=5>Hello everyoneI am Wu Zhengdan, the founder of Shoulder BalletBecause I was an athlete from the age of six to the age of 56Six to 16 years old is the happiest childhood period in my lifeBut this is for all the kids but not for meWhen I was six years old, one of the most basic things I did was to be in pain every dayBut these have laid a very good foundation for meI have a good physical condition, I have good abilities and good flexibilityOnly by doing these well can I be able to be what I am todayLater, I was eliminated for various reasons. I was sent to the team. Ji Qiao still has a sport for skill.I have known my partner since I was six years oldOf course at that time we didn’t know that the future was our partner and he was also my husbandLater, by coincidence, the two of us were teamed up by the teacher and became collaborators in two mixed-skills duo projects.I am very afraid of him bullying me or even hitting meBut for the first time after I saw him, I told him that I said it was okay for me to talk to you, but you must promise me three conditions. The first is not to beat me, the second is not to scold me, and the third is not to talk about me.Why can&#39;t we declineBecause this project has a high altitudeLifted upIf the people below are not happy, it is possible to say about the aboveHe also agreed to my request and kept his promiseSo we cooperated like this since 1992 until now, he has been my greatThis is my life partnerI fell off his shoulder during a competition in 1996. As a result, I slipped and dragged my head to the ground.I almost became Sang LanBut also because of this accidentI was very fortunate to be spotted by the leaders of the Guangzhou Military Region Soldier Acrobatic TroupeThey invited us to Guangzhou and I started a new path in GuangzhouI never thought I would become an acrobatSo when I came to another one, I didn’t even know where my direction was.Because when I was performing abroad, we were just a skill project for two peopleOne re-arranged and then performed abroadThere is a very famous ballet master who is also the head of the Royal Danish Ballet. After seeing our workHe said these two actors are so beautiful they are like two princes and princesses of BarreJust because of his wordsBut I wonder if I can try to wear a pair of pointe shoesHow come I put on these pointe shoes and started my first step but I stood up on my toes on the groundBut I just stand up on the ground, how am I goingNot a professional ballerinaBecause they started at the age of 10I&#39;m almost 20 years old by this timeSo, from the beginning of creating this show for shoulder ballet, it doesn’t mean that you knew to stand in this position from the beginning.But step by step I am on my lover on my partner&#39;s bodyEvery inch of skin has my footprintsBecause he lay on the ground and served me*Of course it&#39;s painful, this process is very difficultAt that time, we wanted to combine with people how to combineOnly go to the person to combine with himBut which position on the body can stand on these are things that we have never thought aboutWe can only try the largest area on the bodyThen one position is on the man’s backWhat should I do if I feel that the younger generation is not difficult enough?On the shouldersBut where do you stand on your shouldersWatching or standingFinally, after thousands of attempts, we feel that only this muscle can not touch the bone and the area that can be at this position is the largestSo we ended up at this placeBut at this position, the picture that everyone sees is only one millimeter away from the front and back, and I will fall offI do it every day in failureWhy is there a picture like thisThis is the shallowness of my spouse&#39;s familyEvery day is bloody because my two feet are on his body, turning and turning around and rubbing here repeatedly every dayThe toe of my pointe shoes is full of blood and pusIn the hot weather like Guangzhou, I finished training every day on the second day. The little thin layer on the top knotted a layer of height.One action against me in summer will come down to youBut I do it like this every day should be no less than 100 times, hundreds of timesWhyActually, I don’t think this kind of pain is a big dealBecause of this hardship, we can all bear it as an actor or an athleteDad broke my foot, I plan to shut down, I can rush upBut the most terrifying thing is confusionWhyBecause we have no directionNo teacher can tell me whether this is right or wrongI have no action essentials, I have no technical requirementsI don’t know how to overcome these problemsI don’t know how well I did it today and I don’t know how it’s done tomorrow.So every day in this confusionThe two of us were in love at that time, but we almost separated because of this workBecause I&#39;m fighting every day, conflicting, arguing, complaining and complaining.We all hope to succeed but we can&#39;t find a directionWhat&#39;s more, I&#39;m confused about what the result will be after this work is released.Because in the process of training, everything is saying that you are ready to build it, are you tired, are you ready to subvert, are you tired?But we don’t know what the result will beIt’s really that kind of feeling is really what I think is the most fearful at that stageThen I feel very lucky that we perseveredNo matter what difficulties we encountered, we sometimes stopped and sometimes wanted to give up, but in the end we persisted.I didn&#39;t rehearse standing on my headWe went to many countries to perform laterI imagined that he would succeed but I really never thought that he would get such a big recognition and affirmationWithout being a Chinese actor, I think I can get the whole world in such an environment because people from all over the world will come here to appreciate it. I feel very proud and proud to be a Chinese actor.I started this show from the second half of 1998 until I won this award in 2002Four years in Guangzhou, I can say that a friend hasn’tMy wife and I came here from Northeast Liaoning and spent 10 hours in the rehearsal field every day.It’s not easy to recall now, but I am also very proud of myself that I have persistedAnd God is very, very good to me because not everyone can get something with their hard work, but I and I have been recognizedAnd I did something very goodAnd it really fully reflects my conditions, my value and my advantagesNow I take it as a deep breath of mineI enjoy a hobbySaid I am almost 40 years old now but I am still on stageAlthough sometimes I feel a little tired, but I think this kind of kind is painful and happy with that kind of enjoymentI enjoy the pleasure that work brings methank youSo what’s going on next is that these are feedbacks from some audiences in our performanceWe performed 30 consecutive performances at the Shanghai Grand TheaterThere are very few building blocks in China that can do this. Every audience can stand up and applaud.Really i really think soEvery time before my performance, I said that when I was standing on the stage because I was tired, I was really tired when I extended dozens of performances in a row. Sometimes I hope the stage lighting can be stopped.Can there be a power outage today or something unexpected? I don’t need to talk about it.Just such a fantasyBut what really started on the stage wasStill so devoted and until I finished the last showAt the end of 1 hour and 50 minutes, I went on stage and bowed to the audience. When the audience stood up and applauded for me, I felt everything was worth it.I think I enjoyed that moment too muchIt’s just that the previous kind and those things disappeared in smoke, all forgottenIf you think this is the happiest moment to be an actorSo till now, I’m still obsessed with the stage. My peak time probably lasted until 2008.So this time it should be said that the fall from the peak was an accidental pregnancyShould be a good thingBut for us, I’m on the stage, when I was at the top, I was not fully mentally prepared, I had a childSo when I gave birth to my baby, my figure was deformedMy martial arts are all goneI can no longer stand on the stage like beforeThen the pain of this recovery process is still fresh in my memory.Because on 37 degrees in Guangzhou, I wore a mile of weight loss bread with plastic wrap and went for a run in the afternoon in Guangzhou for an hour every day.Then stand on singing and eat every dayThen every meal I have no matter how many dishes are on the table, I just eat my mouth and I will leaveBecause only this way I can lose weight quicklyI think my love for my own work means that I have reached a state of eating rice at that time.Then because why do I need to recover so urgentlyI found i&#39;m speechlessBecause I really feel that in addition to what I did 20 years ago so many years ago, one thing I did is to be on stageI found that I can&#39;t do anything elseI can only reflect my own value on the stageSo I very much hope to be able to return to the stage soonMine, mine, mine, prepare to chase, I can’t be as soft as beforeBut one thing I’m very fortunate is that I’ve been away from the stage for so longI find that sometimes in life you may not always be on the stage and you will get better and betterStopped this year I think I have achieved different resultsMy life my stage experienceI feel differentWhen I express to the audience, I feel that my emotions and my thoughts convey another kind of information.Everyone said Zheng Dan, you have sublimated again, you have improved againI think it means that when a person reaches a different age, the harvest is different and the feeling is different.Later, I felt that there are a lot of such utilitarians who don’t practice the character length. I don’t think I can feel it until a certain age.This is one of my feelingsWhy later I returned to the stage and got this Ulannova fake in RussiaThis award is a very rare event for all dancersAs an acrobat, I should be regarded as a cross-border actor who can get this honor.I&#39;m very proud and I also cherishSo now I’m not just an actor, I’m more of an inheritor and a lighterBecause my responsibility and obligation is to inherit and develop such a miracle created by the Chinese ballet on my shoulders.In addition, I also trained many childrenI hope these children can realize their dreams and I can help themAt the same time, I also believe that the children who learn to dance must be the strongest and most able to endure hardshipThen I believe they will succeed in anything they do in the futureIt should be said that it is the ultimate perfection that can never be achieved, but every moment in the unremitting pursuit of perfection is the magic of balletI want to say that for the first half of my life, I am very grateful for my previous encounters in balletI’m very proud of standing on the stage now, standing on my husband’s shouldersI think I&#39;m invincible at that momentthank you all</seg>
<seg id=6>good afternoon everyoneI am Zhang Wuxiong from Shanghai Institute of Microsystems, Chinese Academy of SciencesCan you help me introduce to you in this report today, what we represent through the Internet is how China Information Technology handles the safety of this project.I want to look at it from several aspectsWe all hate this tofu project, but the current stage of the tofu project is still inevitableWe can look back at our 2007 Jiujiang Bridge collapsed instantly because of this spreading impact.This was a very important world at the timeThere are a lot of tofu dregs projects that can run on the highwayWe can see a flat one on the Internet is this high-speed highway in Tianjin, Gansu.Soon after the opening to traffic in 2011, although the cost of his building was as high as one month per kilometerBut a few days after it was built, the highway was cracked and then it was immediately unusable and entered a maintenance period.We can also see a world in ShanghaiWe had a similar world on the lotus river at the timeBut because of the land, the buildings collapsed instantlyOf course, the prices of the second-hand houses of his and his second-hand houses are not too low.I thought it was later discovered that this building’s knowledge structure for Polya was quite goodIt’s just that he didn’t do a good job of this foundation, but it can’t be denied that he did cut corners at the time.In fact, as the Internet of ThingsHe can know his overall understanding of maintenance from the source of this building from the very beginning to its operation.When we can first look at what is the Internet of ThingsThe term &quot;Internet&quot; refers to the architecture diagram we provided to Premier Wen when he visited and inspected the Wuxi branch during our experiment in 2009.But the Internet of Things is adjusted in the temperatureNow we all know the word Internet of ThingsSo since the term Internet may be strange to everyone in life, we can see that there are actually many things in life that are already the Internet.I will take a look at the diagonal bikes of Mobike ofo. These are some of the better applications of the Internet of Things.Now the applications with a large area on the Internet are smart driving or using carsEach car has a network composed of hundreds of these different sensors to monitor the quality of the car and detect the running status of the car.So the following is the kind of joint efforts that Shanghai is currently implementingGrow telephone poles, street light poles, etc. directly into a systemWe can make a charging pile for him below, then we can make WiFi for him, and then we can basically do some environmental monitoring for him.This is a very good application to the InternetWhen I can give a review of a few early IoT applications, I will start from the right.This is the blue algae monitoring we sat in Taihu Lake in 2019, but the water quality in the Taihu Lake basin is also very bad.Then the system behind Bo’s darkroom is also a large single IoT system at the time.We can see the leftThis is the Internet of Things system we used for this ordinary airportFrom 2006 to now, it is still working normally for more than ten yearsFor comparison, we have transferred a few people who are going to destroy but he hasn&#39;t done it yetThe main reason is that we have the system of the Internet of Things to perform some early monitoring of it, which can prevent these saboteurs from coming earlier than before.So back to today’s topic is like what happened in the Internet of Things, pay attention to the safety of buildingsThis is our first look at the safety of the construction of the buildingWhat can the Internet doThis is how many of us in the palace are very heavyHow can a person in a historical building ensure that the right person is that a qualified person is doing what he can do in the river?On the other hand, we have to ensure that his materials, including his craftsmanship, and his safeguards are up to standard.We can see if there are some such IoT systems in the first construction site here. We can monitor in real time whether the managers are doing it.It has an electricianIs he really an electrician operating some live equipment?Does the operator of this tower crane also have the corresponding certificate?Correspondingly, there are some technologies that can be affectionate with those systems and will do some positioningSo are the building materials qualified?We can also enter each material from the early stage. I will monitor it and place it in the designated location after the inspection.When someone re-spots these building materials, the system can maintain a traceability in the entire process from his storage to delivery to use.Just like we do food traceabilityThen the third person is that we have to ensure that the construction process is up to standardWe will have some Internet methods and long-term methods, including some of our video monitoring methods, to detect whether it is up to standardIn addition, we can see whether this safeguard measure is the guarantee for our scaffolding to be stable and reliable.In this case, we will also make some sensors on it to monitor its qualitySo in this case, we have made a complete set of this solution or system based on the Internet of ThingsWe can see that there are 10 kinds of sensors underneathWe can manage the personnel, manage this tower crane, and manage this dog and duck, including the fitness fund.We also manage the environment, including the exhaust, drainage, etc., including videos, as well as the in and out of vehicles, including his circle, and some automatic detection.With these sensors, we control all the conditions of the entire construction site through information meansFind a system of various applications of this kind that we will build afterwards to perform security monitoring and analysis on itfor exampleFirst of all, the one on the left is when we have some safety accidents, I want to make sure where my personnel are, where are my equipment, and where are my rescue measures.Truth also has a system to monitorThe safety of the tower crane is also a very importantWe will have some sensors on this crane to detect whether it is tilted or not due to swing, etc.Then the environmental construction and light color are the very strict requirements currently required by the government.We can keep the water in the atmosphere polluted, so this is a very important part of the Internet of Things to solve this problem.Regarding the glass curtain wall, this is a big issue we are consideringIn our country, this glass curtain wall has been a large area of information since the 1980s.The tall buildings in our city are also very denseOur entire glass curtain wall occupancy rate has reached a very high amount of 85% of the worldBut the glass curtain wall also has its problemAlthough it currently has many advantages compared to the United States, its construction is also relatively simpleBut the life span of glass is only 15 yearsThe most commonly used structural glue for chemical glass has been taught for about 10 yearsSo whether it is broken glass or a structural teacher school will have a great impact on himSo in the field of glass curtain wall monitoringUnfortunately, because the world’s largest glass curtain wall uses Fruit China, his research in this field abroad is actually not so advanced.Only now the traditional detection may be the most possible. We have some detection equipment backed by a piece of glass to exploreThen there is no detection method is to use this kind of rubber mallet to hit his glass, so it is relatively primitive and backwardAt the same time, the life span of some of our building materials is mainly live broadcastIncluding structural exchange, including some of the structures inside, the construction life is relatively short, unlike our surface concrete structureThe third reason is that this external factor has a relatively large influenceTyphoons have a great impact on bridges, and typhoons have the same effect on glass.Constantly to shockAt the same time, our glass is cleaned every yearThen when the external wall is plugged in, the tower crane is hoisted downThen when the wind blows, he swings the motion back to it for many years, so it brings a lot of safety problems.In our early days, the Shanghai Center had similar things in the past few years.After the whole glass fellFortunately, he hit the car and didn&#39;t hit anyoneThink about how long will it take to fall an egg can kill a person, let alone a glassAlthough we have used the technology and means of the Internet of Things to solve this problem, we have built a glass curtain wall safety monitoring system. This is to explain some cooperation with those schools in the same home.I think we have the sensor in the previous section that can detect his vibration. 10 Don’t include the temperature, etc., which affect the safety of the glass.Then there are some transmission technologies of this narrowband Internet of Things that can easily collect some status data of the front-end glass.Then after he comes up, we can use this platform and there will be some big data cloud computing methods in the future.Including the combination with the more fashionable artificial intelligence nowWe conducted a lot of this data collection and analysisIt can tell in advance to build a model that the glass curtain wall will breakIn this case, we can know how much the risk isThe second question is which day can we get to the glass curtain wallIn fact, according to our current safety standards, the glass still has a certain degree of authority, but I believe that it will be simpler in the future after using our system.Back to the third question, how do we solve the Internet of Things is to continue in the process of operationThe picture on the left shows our Jin Mao TowerWe think of the high-rise buildings that the safety of this building may first think ofIn fact, the place where I am very dangerous now is these Xiaowei places including this kind of group rental housingThere are also more people living in the writing workshop, including this kind of hydraulic computer, which is also a very big fire hazard.Just like our current theater, if there is a fire next to it, people may have already withdrawn, but we don’t even know if the next door is on fire.We may be very late when we arrive laterAre there any methods and measures that can solve or give us some hints?There isSo during our operation, we thought of a lot of methods and then made a lot of CEOs of Internet of People for a lot of different applications.Well, this is now a relatively hot way to teach this independent strictThe traditional smoke rod may be linked to the sprinkler facility by the fire department.Any building must have this set of equipment if it is to be acceptedNow there are some independent smoke feelings, so we can integrate this kind of technology including the hotter narrowband Internet of Things nb-iot including Laura and so on.Because there are two transmission technologies for these bombs, it can have a life span of more than 10 years, so we can integrate some of this kind of voice broadcast information on it after we leave it in the room.If there is a fire next door, we may know it in this room instantly.Well, with the support of the Shanghai Economic and Information Commission and the Science and Technology CommissionWe care about this Yangpu and Hongkou from this Oriental Pearl, and now there are nearly 30,000 in this free-standing smokeSo if you are interested in every family in the future, you can also buy this kind of equipment and install one.You can use the App to see if there is such a fire or hidden danger in your homeWhat is the safety of the elevator is also a big problem nowShanghai is actually a place where elevators are widely usedThe number of 300,000 elevators in our house has been in service for more than 15 years, and there may be thousands of hits.Then there are seven to eighty thousand units from 10 to 15 years old, so this is also a big raw materialThe specific actual service life is generally referred to as a broken relationship according to the requirements, so how to do this maintenance is also a big problem.Although we have not had so many accidents, the Internet of Things can certainly do a lot for the safety of this electrical appliance.In the future, we will now install a lot of sensors in the elevator, including the floor, including the Heisei, including the smoke pole, including the OK room, which can control the current of the main wire of the elevator, and so on, including its temperature to determine whether the elevator is not. SafetyAfter we can do this, we can collect a lot of status data of the elevator, so we can do a lot of artificial intelligence analysis remotely.After the analysis, one thing I can actually do is the rationalized Weibo of the elevatorNow that the elevator is normally maintained, someone may go to the bank for maintenance on paper materials.Did he goHow about itNo one knowsAfter getting the interesting Internet of Things system in the future, we can effectively guarantee the safety of each elevatorWell, this is actually not my majorThat is, we will write an envelope in this building, including some water supply, including some faculty diagrams that stimulate waterThen there are some technical means with the Internet of ThingsWe can measure the outlet of the fresh air through the sensor and take a look at the wind to see the quality of the air in this room. What is its temperature and humidity? Then adjust the most suitable temperature and humidity.Can you shampoo? You can see if the flow rate of the water is in the same formula and if there is some pollution in it, etc.In this way, the safety of the building can be guaranteedThis was done by our partner on that Guangzhou Xiaoman waistFor the tall building of the sales building, we can also look at the swing of the tall building after we have some sensors on it. Look at his vibrations, then we can judge whether it is in a safe state.I think this is also me. I think this kind of thing will be used in high-rise buildings like Shanghai Center in the future.Then the other one is my job in 78 yearsAt that time, we did this safety protection for the middle route of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project.Then the middle line is from the Danjiangkou Reservoir, which is at the junction of North Henan, which diverts 1432 kilometers of water to Beijing and Tianjin, with 11 cubic meters of water per year in Beijing and Tianjin.But there will be a lot of questions in thisIf you don’t look at him, the fan of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project will tell you that this gorge is called Jiaqiao.With his heroes is also very complicatedWell, there are indeed many security issuesLike the above kind of complaints about two kilometers, the field is full of waterThousands of tons of water puts a lot of pressure on the base of the whole person.I feel that we have a variety of sensors on it to monitor its displacement into strong seepage flow, so we built the project safety monitoring accordingly.At the same time, let us combine some peripheral weather information, including information from this weather bureau or some local rainfall stations.At the same time, we also did some water quantity and water quality monitoring, etc.Bring up the TV opportunity to protect the safety of the entire South-to-North Water Diversion ProjectAt the same time, we also built the anti-intrusion playExplain that if someone is afraid that I am embarrassed to enter my channel, I can know that I can find him in advance and point him out.I feel that words can also improve the fullness of vocational engineeringLet me give you an exampleJust like this kind of invasion is also a big bank insideThis is a manual dug project for us, so once people fall into this channel, it is difficult for you to get up.Because this is a concrete slope, it’s very difficult to climb up.Although human safety is also a core issue in the entire South-to-North Water Transfer ProjectThen I talked about some of the previous technical methods of the Internet of Things to solve this or to ensure the safety of this buildingWhether it’s any bridge, whether it’s this building, whether it’s a highway or a project like this or that.The new type of sensor in the future is indeed a very core face-lift in the future, and some realizations can be done in the future.When we talk about the future of smart buildings, it must be to update the saturated operation of the building. You know that the entire process of future maintenance needs to be informatized.Then the human body, on the one hand, improves the safety level of this building, on the other hand, it also provides some convenience for people’s lives.But I can see that our country actually has a lot of flaws in this new sensor.On the one hand, we really need a variety of new types of sensors, but my sister sees that especially in the high-end smart sensorsThe United States, Japan and Germany are relatively advanced, accounting for 70% of the world’s largest, and our country’s is only about 10%.So at the same time, from the perspective of production, there are only more than 10,000 in our country.So this one is also one of our big shortcomings, then another one is the good things, where are the good thingsThis is our country’s sensor industryFrom the original imitation, now it has begun to gradually expand to the high-endSome chip factories in our country have begun to gradually move towards high-end line linesLet me give you a simple exampleSome of our high-speed acceleration gas, including the investment of a sum of money, will be better used in the military industry, and now it is also being transferred to civilian use.Then we have some pressure. Now, who is the time table, your eyes are also beginning to applyIncluding some of the explosion-proof sensors we made, we have already used them during the security check, including Pudong Airport.We have some of this millimeter wave equipment, including those at the security checkpoint, which have already been used in these equipment at the airport.Having said that, I believe you will be able to achieve breakthroughs in many of our high-end sensors in the next three to five years.So with these sensors, we can mention this prefabricated building for the building, especially the future building, and we can provide some more powerful technologies and methods for his safety in the future to escort his safety.Thanks everyone</seg>
<seg id=7>Hello everyoneI am Linpin. I am both an observer of the two-dimensional culture and a participant of the two-dimensional culture.I believe everyone here has heard of the concept of 2000 more or less.But maybe everyone may not all understand where the concept of the second element came from and why it became popularIf we trace the etymology of the second element, we will find that this word is actually a word from JapanIn Japan, he was originally a technical term in the field of geometry, which means two-dimensional space and two-dimensional world.Today we are going to specifically discuss the second element as a buzzword on the Internet. In fact, it was not until the mid-1990s that it obtained its semantics and its usage.In Minecraft, we can trace the source of all evil back to a good animation called Mobile Battleship Nadeshiko which was first broadcast in 1996.This is a sci-fi cartoon with the background of the story set at the end of the 22nd centuryThere are a group of particularly interesting characters in this cartoonThey were a long, long time ago. In fact, what is said here is a long, long time ago, as long as it is the 21st century. They are the descendants of a group of human immigrants who were cooked on Jupiter by the earth’s civilization in the 21st century.When their ancestors were cooked to Jupiter, they carried a 3D cartoon called Kekan Man with them.For a long time, these three uninhibited and touching ones have become an exceptionally special existence in the Mu News list.Because of these people, they not only enthusiastically worship and serve as the people declared by Sanjiang Machine to be their own life creed, but they are also deeply obsessed with the heroine of this cartoon.Caicai is her own dream goddessHowever, these people who are eager to have contact with the prince can never realize their wishes. Why?Because just like us off the screen and the person named Mou on the screen, after all, we are in two distinct worlds.Among them, the mother who is an animation audience is in two completely separate events from the wife who is an animation character in the middle distance.Oh, everyone can feel that this is an insurmountable physical and physiological limitationFaced with such a restriction, these people who are deeply trapped in Wuwan Sports can only persuade each otherAlthough the prince is good, it is a woman of the second dimension after allI don’t know if this line resonated deeply with everyoneWhen I saw this line for the first time, he laughed. He was a deep machine. My sympathy wasAnd when it was broadcast in Japan, he also aroused a lot of Japanese anime and game lovers called otaku. Their supplyEveryone can think about that we have all deeply loved some animated characters, comic characters, and game characters.But it is absolutely impossible for us to have physical or physical contact with these characters we loveBecause these characters are our profound characters, after all, they only exist in the virtual world composed of Ovi line plane images and dynamic pictures.Because this line is so persistent and the concept of the second element is so precise and concise to highlight the dimensional difference that separates us from them highlights the media characteristics that make them appear so special.Therefore, since the mid-1990s, more and more animation game enthusiasts have borrowed the concept of two dimensions to refer to the two-dimensional virtual world created by each piece of animation, comics, games, etc.Anyway, the point you want to emphasize is that we look at the person for this purpose, but when he used the concept for 20 years, many anime game enthusiasts use the concept of two-dimensional, they seem to often separate the two-dimensional and the three-dimensional.That is to separate the two-dimensional virtual world from the three-dimensional reality event that we are in between.It seems that this constitutes a kind of opposition between truth and falsehoodBut if you understand the potential context of the sentenceIn fact, he deeply expressed his sincere and strong love for the two-dimensional world and the two-dimensional characters.This is a kind of affection that makes them earnestly desire to have real contact with the prince.It is this kind of love, but they devoutly regard the touching spirit as their life creed.According to my observation and experience of the two-dimensional cultureWe can also notice that in the sense of reincarnation in the mind rather than physical reincarnation, many anime game enthusiasts often get quite sincere emotional experience from the world of the second dimension.Even compared to the three-dimensional society that needs to take some kind of mask to deal with yang and yin violations.Their emotional investment in the two-dimensional world may be more sincere and strongIt seems that the relationship between the positive and the real and the virtual cannot be simply distinguished by the dualistic thinking framework.Perhaps the question that is more worthy of follow-up isWhy do so many people have such sincere and strong emotional involvement in objects that are often called virtual characters in the virtual worldHere I will introduce an academic theoretical term to help me explain and interpret such a social and cultural trend.When I was undergraduate, there was an experienced senior or an elder who taught me this way. He said that postmodernism is wide and everything can be installed inside.I am here to share with you a theoretical concept. Postmodern is actually a concept with divergent opinions.People with viruses will have different ways of using them, and different arguments will be filled with different theoretical connotations.Then I’m here to help me share the concept with you, in what specific sense did I use it?I am learning from the usage of this fat mansion on the right behind you and me, a Japanese otaku cultural research expert named Dongdong Hao JiIn other words, it is borrowing from the French postmodernist philosopher Lie, who asked him for his statement.The current situation after calling them first means the decline of the grand narrativeWhat is a grand narrative?The grand narrative here refers to a series of conceptual systems that unite its members in the modern political community since the Enlightenment.They provide authoritative explanations for the operating rules of societyThey give transcendence value and meaning to the practice of human beings. They arrive at a consistent narrative of the development process of history.But in the great historical changes of the 20th centurySome grand narratives that have a supporting significance for modern civilization gradually lose their persuasiveness and appealFrom the outbreak of the First World War to the end of the Cold War, in this extreme age, one after another tragic and traumatic historical events almost destroyed the trust building of humanistic enlightenment rationality and historical progress theory.The replacement of liberal capitalism and modern technology has made the entire society full of fluidity and highly fragmented, while also largely dispelling the social foundation of some grand narratives.As the grand narrative of modernity collapses and disintegrates in the postmodern stateWhat we are ushering in is a vacuum of cultural valuesJust like those Jupiter people who were banished to Jupiter were cut off the spiritual connection between their own earth civilizations.Those of us who are in the post-modern situation are finally exposed to it and growing up, it is also difficult for us to smoothly and convincingly connect our spiritual world to the grand narrative that modern civilization once tried to construct.It is precisely in this era that the two-dimensional culture played a very important role in the advance list for us to play a very important spiritual effect.In the two-dimensional culture, it is like the life of Jigang has filled the spiritual and cultural value vacuum of those Jupiter people. There are many excellent two-dimensional works. They often tell a fascinating story while providing a set of worldview settings that are compatible with Kangcheng&#39;s grand view. systemThese worldview setting systems provide some alternative grand narratives for those who are in the ruins of grand narratives in their own unique ways. We can also call them the grand narrative of the second dimension.Of course, the piano enthusiasts are composed of diverse forms, but in terms of my personal acceptance experienceIn my mind, the most attractive part of the two-dimensional element is precisely the compensatory spiritual effect exerted by the grand narrative of the two-dimensional element.This Dragon Ball or You Yu Hakusho that can’t come out of street comics for a price of five cents since I was a kidNaruto Digimon that I watched on my desktop through the TV when I was a teenagerThen this year, I will contact the boiling magical girl Madoka through a tablet, a laptop, and a smartphone.These two-dimensional cultural works that I deeply love and make me deeply indulged. They tend to break the boundaries between the so-called traditional and modern Eastern and Western secular and mysterious technology and magic.The various elements of knocking down the floor have cast a set of magnificent worldview setting systemUnder the care of such a two-dimensional world view, technology is no longer boring and cold, but seems to become pan-necked and magical.At the same time, it cannot and does not constitute an evocation of pre-modern ghosts, but a spectacle garden that uses emerging media to gain fascinating charm.This kind of worldview setting allows those characters that we may identify and bring into have extraordinary abilities.And experience all kinds of wonderful encounters in a magnificent and interesting time and spaceThese wonderful encounters of mine will be a kind of visual effect that the emerging media such as animation games are not crazy and cool.Therefore, they constitute a kind of pleasure reactor, just like someone who produces a powerful development pleasure reactor to provide an endless stream of pleasure for those comic readers, animated audiences, and game players.More importantly, for me, sports that take place under the setting of these two-dimensional worldviews are often given a certain connected community destiny and even great significance of the destiny of the world during the unfolding of the storyline.At the same time, the characters are placed in a relatively extreme situation to take the amount of emotion that stimulates the bonds between the characters.The fetter I am talking about here is a two-dimensional term, it can only be a strong and profound emotional connection between peopleFor me, there is a kind of virtual reality routine that is common and tried repeatedly.As the world-scale crisis continues to deepen, the bond between the characters is constantly facing dangers and tests that are close to life and death.In order to maintain this fragile but must be guarded chicken in extreme situations* those we will identify and bring into the two-dimensional roleThe link that must be in English is the key to stimulate potential. The painting demonstrates that the energy field contained in the inner universe is to save the external heavy rain while being fettered by each other.Why does such a way of gaining momentum hit me so oftenIn my opinion, it is because the prajna is able to successfully create a good substitute for the audience of the sigh animation, the readers of the comics, the readers of the game, and the sincere mainland period, then such a bond may reach emotional strength, but our bodies Two-dimensional enthusiasts in a post-modern situation are difficult to experience in the middle-level three-dimensional life repeated with SLR machinesFurthermore, the world view setting and plot design of such a two-dimensional work will also allow many transcendence values that have been lost for me to be expressed at least temporarily within the story frame and emotional structure of the work.When I saw that Monkey King elaborated this week, it’s not nonsense, the principle of adaptation, not chaos, I’ll call him her uneasy here.When I saw Kakarot, he was constantly surpassing his limits in order to protect his important partner, to protect the earthWhen I saw Naruto Suiwu constantly enduring hardships and trials that ordinary people can&#39;t imagine in order to realize a world of great harmony where people can understand each other.When I saw the Cavaliers disappeared and the civil used their own life’s love for everyone, they would ignore the holy grail between victory and destruction.When Kihara sacrificed his life and sacrificed all traces of his existence to reverse the cause and effect of the entire universe, when he brought the ultimate hope for every magical girl who was about to die in despair.The enthusiasm and sense of sublime that come from this is also something I can hardly experience in the three-dimensional social atmosphere of nihilism, cynicism, exquisite self-interest, and extreme individualism.This is the grand narrative of the second dimension in this sense. For me, it may have played a spiritual compensatory role for many, many fans.For two-dimensional enthusiasts, we often hear some severe elders make such human criticismsFor example, you are escaping from realityFor example, you are addicted to virtualBut in my opinion, let’s observe and understand the painting from another angleIf the grand narrative of modernity no longer has truthful meaning and value for usIf we have avoided the unavoidable being among a kind of real ruinsSo can we also understand the hobby of the second element as a flexible spiritual pursuitOr understood as an immersive experience of a hyper-real world that is more real than realityWhat I told him is so prosperous, especially when I give an example, maybe many, many friends here will think that I am a good person.As a two-dimensional enthusiast who has seen many battlesWhen facing a three-dimensional friend, he is often accused of being recognized as being taunted by a patient with secondary diseaseHowever, you can rest assured that Chinese patients like me are actually only one of the types and may even be an old-fashioned type among the diversified two-dimensional fans.What I’m going to talk about next may make many three-dimensional people even more uneasy.Because we can observe that since the 1990s, it is not only the cynicism of the posterity era that has permeated the world.Moreover, as far as the specific social context of Japanese society is concerned, the Japanese people have encountered a kind of bubble economy. The bursting of the economy has come. The long-term economic stagnation has made it known as the Heisei Great Depression.At the age when they grew up in the era of the Great Depression, they faced the solidified reality of the class, faced with the fate of a benign interaction between their struggle and the journey of history, they would inevitably fall into a heavy sense of emptiness, but the middle line was heavy. Sighing powerlesslyAt the same time, these young people who are as perplexed and decadent as the hero of Neon Genesis Evangelion Dingjinji are living in a post-industrial consumer society.They can access the rich and diverse cultural consumer products produced by the highly developed cultural and creative industries for them in batches and segmentation at any time and anywhere, and get pleasure and comfort from these consumer product lists.Under such a background of the times, a group of otakus, who were called or grew up as abandoned houses in Heisei, appeared.In the words of Dong Hiroki, this is a group of eras that have emerged in a more thorough postmodern situation that do not require a grand narrative.So the question is which one is the best mining technologySmoked meat pathogenic sugarExcavator you deserveHey, I’m sorry, I’m the Chinese disease. I have food here. This is a mess.problemThe question is if these otakus don’t even need the grand narrative of the second dimension, then what is the profit driving them to make the second dimension consumption?According to Dong Hao Ji&#39;s statement, it is neither the superficial story nor the deep world view setting that really provides the driving force for their cultural consumption.It is a two-dimensional character who can be extracted from the story situation in the pure present storyLet these characters be continuously copied in the Mongolian element database of the promotionBefore explaining this new concept of the cute element database, there is no need to review a very important industrial model of the two-dimensional industry.Everyone should have heard of this, which is IP operation or Japan, which is often called Mi Tian Mix QihuaFor example, after advanced skills become a highly popular comicSoon there will be an animated game adaptation of Advanced Giant and a series of peripheral derivative productsFor example, after Neon Genesis Evangelion became a popular animeSoon there will be an adaptation of Evangelion comics and a series of peripheral derivative products.For example, at the Gate of DestinyAfter becoming a highly popular game, it soon had its adaptations of animated cartoons and a series of peripheral derivative products.It is not just the cultural industry of the second dimension that will produce cultural products with multiple media carriers and develop product groups that span multiple media carriersAnd enthusiasts will also use existing products as user-generated content that I use as a material library to produce a variety of media carriers.For example, doujin doujin painting doujin video doujin radio drama doujin game cosplay doujin surrounding handicrafts, etc.The problem is here. We can imagine that the storyline in the process of fan-derived in the process of this IP operation is actually constantly changing.Even the world view setting is not stable but will derive or hybridize various parallel universesThen what is it that drives the two-dimensional users to travel in the sea of content composed of the IP product chain and the fan fun culture?Judging from the current situation, the most probable answer is not the grand narrative of the second dimension that patients with secondary diseases like me would love.It’s the two-dimensional characters who are attracted to the two-dimensional users as deeply as the prince’s attracting new recruits.What I want to emphasize here is that these two-dimensional characters can be separated from the story situation and separated from the world view setting and exist independently.Popular products like Hatsune Miku or drop-downThe role setting of a virtual idol with only one or a group of two-dimensional characters is sufficient to support a product chain that spans multiple media carriers.So what makes these characters still maintain the minimum relative consistency for those two-dimensional users who love them when they shuttle between products of different media carriers and parallel universes set by different worldviews?It is the specific combination of labelled non-narrative personal elements in specific charactersOr in Dong Hao Ji&#39;s words, it is the specific combination of manganese in a series of manganese elements in a specific role.The Mongolian element mentioned here refers to the human element that allows the two-dimensional character to evoke the love of the two-dimensional userIn the logic of the highly mature cultural industryThose two-dimensional characters that attract a certain range of users’ personal elements will be analyzed and summarized in a Mongolian element database that can be copied and reproduced by the cultural industry.Practitioners in the two-dimensional industry and creators of user-generated content can get what they need from this large-scale Mongolian element database.Through the distance of the manganese element, through the reorganization of the gate element, through the single cycle of a certain element, a variety of cute characters are producedOh my saying this seems very abstract, so let&#39;s give an exampleBehind me, there are three very popular two-dimensional cute charactersOn my right, everyone on the left. This is one of the heroines of the landmark animation Evangelion that will be premiered in 1995 tomorrow.Then he is also a label-like character with a combination of cute elements like Miss Tsundere Double PonytailTsundere Double Horsetail Miss, the response of the manned equipment market proved to be a popular way of manganese element combination, and soon it was also widely adopted in the two-dimensional industry or widely.But the adoption he should pay attention to does not mean repetitionBut in the process of reorganization, new cute characters are generatedIn the middle, one of the heroines of the fate series who appeared later, Ren Bangling, and the important role in the door of the fate stone door list, is not with meow him.They all have a combination of attributes like Tsundere Double Ponytail MissBut he has some new manganese elements that are subtly different from this Asuka. A new combination has taken place, and some new cute characters have been formed.Or we can look at Sun Shangxiang in the glory of the king againAs a person, please note that he has no direct relationship with the princess Wu in history.But as a people drawn from Princess Wu, he was also endowed with a combination of cute elements such as Miss Double Ponytail.At the same time, the designer of the game has a setting of using bows and arrows for Sun Shangxiang’s proficiency in reference to historical legends and popular culture.For him, he will appear in fate, and he will give you thatRefer to such a setting for a double ponytailed lady like Sun Shangxiang and add a collage combination and a single hand-held long-range artillery weapon.It can be found that the manganese element combination was established in the setting of the second dimension in a battle that had to break the boundary between historical interpretation and science fiction and fantasy.Then we will find that although many, many otakus who have a deep love, they will emphasize that this two-dimensional character that I love is unique.However, in the logic of the cultural industry, those symbols that are regarded as the same character in animation, comics, video games and peripheral figure cosplay.In fact, it is nothing more than a specific combination of certain manganese elements extracted from the databaseOr is it the implementation and presentation of the combination of these Mongolian elements in each specific worldview setting story situation and media carrierSo why is such a two-dimensional character composed of Mongolian elements collaged to have a continuous attraction to those and the family?An explanation that may be established but I cannot agree without reservation is thisEvery one of us lives in a society of strangers with highly mobile market employment and large-scale urbanization transformation.Such a society makes it easy for each of us to fall into a sense of loneliness and alienation of atomized existence.The decline of the grand narrative we just mentioned is the kind of universal and shared social ethical norms that can hardly be established.Further exacerbated such a dilemma of atomized survivalFor these postmodern subjects, whether it is the other person in the interpersonal relationship or the other person as the social rule systemIt’s hard to serve as a bottle that can provide us and the prince fans with definite answers, but it constitutes one after another troublesome puzzleIn this situation, in the two-dimensional worldThose diversified but with labels to follow the two-dimensional role of A Zhai digital survival provides a convenient way to obtain affection and satisfaction without going through the intermediary of others.Those manganese elements that are both creative and highly targeted to meet the needs can establish a set of fast loops for two-dimensional users between online lack and satisfaction.Because of this, the specific combination of these cute elements and these manganese elementsThe CP combination between Mongolian element combination and Mongolian element combination can effectively serve as the searched keywordLeading two-dimensional users through various styles of search engines to call content resources that meet their needs from the ocean of big dataIt proves that they can effectively act as a clear and identifiable need. The goal drives these two-dimensional enthusiasts to obtain a relatively stable pleasure from the constantly changing world view setting list of constantly changing story situations according to their own specific tastes. sourceSuch a popular phenomenon not only reminds us of a social and cultural trend worthy of attention, but also raises some very important issues worthy of our further discussion.When the fascinating fantasy of the second dimension provides an alternative satisfaction for the artistic and emotional needs of the postmodern subjectIs grand narrative no longer necessary for the operation of the human communityWhen those fascinating characters collaged with human elements and digital images are filled with the new media interface of the post-industrial consumer society, are human beings no longer necessary for the establishment of intimacy?Furthermore, with more and more IP operation projects and more and more mid cigarettes, Mix Qihua tries to establish such a whole industry chain that opens up the animation, game, and voice industry.With more and more popular products, they combine real-life image materials with computer-synthesized bright digital animations.When producing the fascinating fantasies we indulge inAs more and more new technologies such as virtual reality technology and augmented reality technology have been commercialized on a large scaleThe boundary between virtual and real, the boundary between them is becoming more and more blurred and ambiguousWhat we can actually ask is whether the two concepts of the two-dimensional and three-dimensional, which are based on differences and based on opposition, will also become an outdated concept.I can&#39;t give clear answers to these interesting questionsActually, I just want to play a role to inspire others, hoping to inspire more creative and insightful thinking and discussion.That’s it for today’s sharing. Thank you very much for listening patiently.thanks</seg>
<seg id=8>Hello everyoneWelcome everyone to pay attention to our Unit Degradation System Advanced CourseI am the R&amp;D engineer of Baidu Music Platform.This lesson will introduce you to mcat, which is a bit open source for dialogue management.First, let’s take a look at the overall structure of the dialogue systemGenerally speaking, we can decompose the task-based dialogue system into three modules: dialogue understanding, dialogue management, resource retrieval, task executionIn the dialog system of the hotel reservation, the user entered the standard room meeting for me to help me book today’s Beijing Home Inn Shangdi store.The dialogue comprehension module received such a natural language input and processed it to figure out that the intent corresponding to this sentence has been resignedThis intention text includes the hotel room type and time when booking a hotelThis intention and red tide will be used as input to our subsequent dialogue management moduleThe dialogue management module selects the corresponding action to execute according to the input one end and the locomotive check combined with the current dialogue stateFor example, according to the intention of booking a hotel and the time of the hotel room, these words collide with the dialogue management module. Now you can start the hotel reservation.Thereby selecting the action of booking a hotel to guide the subsequent resource retrieval as the task execution module to run the corresponding operationCall the external service of the reserved hotel to complete the hotel reservation and feedback the reservation result to the user in the form of natural languageSo we have completed a round of dialogue interactionOkay, what kind of framework does such a dialogue system architecture correspond to INS?Similar to the previous dialogue system, the system framework that we can have is simply disassembled into two partsOne is the original dialogue understanding serviceHe is responsible for parsing natural language input into dialogue intent and has resignedThe other part is the dialogue management and support reduction task execution moduleThis part is because you provide two ways for developers to choose to implementThe first option is that developers can implement simple dialogue responses by drawing responses on the cloud platform configurationThis choice is the offline dialogue management framework of dmp that we will mainly introduce in this lesson.Through the use of the developers of Dimple, more complex dialogue process management and task execution can be realizedLater, we will introduce the design principle and usage of bmpde.First, let’s take a look at the dialogue abstraction in Dianpei’sThere are two main concepts in Dianpei’s dialogue in China, namely dialogue state and policy.The dialogue state indicates the state of the current user&#39;s dialogue with the systemPolicy can be understood as the most basic logical unit of dialogue processingFor each round of dialogue request dmp receives the user&#39;s natural language input to access the cloud dialogue understanding service to parse natural language into dialogue intentions.According to the obtained intention and word direction at the same time combined with the current dialogue state of MK, the corresponding Polo water can be selected for executionFor example, when we say that the policy a selected here, the dialogue processing logic described by the policy will be executed.In the process of processing, you may access external services or knowledge bases to obtain data and generate picture books or instructions as the final skill response of the systemAt the same time, after the execution of the policy is completed, Dianpei will update the current dialogue state to the dialogue state specified by the crack lock, such as the dialogue state here, so as to realize the jump update of the dialogue state.Below we mainly introduce the concept of soaking water in Dianchi LakeThis is the most basic unit of dlp&#39;s installation processing dialogue logicIt defines the complete behavior in a specific conversation stateA crack includes three parts: trigger condition, business parameter and open contentLet’s take a look at these three parts based on the conversation history of the hotel reservation.The first is the trigger conditionThis trigger condition defines the conditions under which this policy will be selectedFor example, here we define a Polo water departure condition. Its intent is to book a hotel, the market is the hotel room type and the time it is 001Then when the dialogue system is in a downturn, the user input helps me to book the label of the Beijing Home Inn Shangdi store today.We analyze the intention of booking a hotel through natural language understanding services and include the three words of hotel room type and time.Then the soaking water that defines this trigger condition will choose to executeExcept for this article, the second part is business parametersIt defines the parameters that need to be used in the logical processing of this dialogThe parameters here can be super value or the result of function executionDevelopers can define dialogue processing logic here to obtain parameters to access external services or execute functions to obtain the data needed for our dialogue replyFor example, in this example, we define three variables to obtain the hotel room type time 324 Cao ZhiFinally, a variable of function type is definedThis function makes hotel reservations based on the first three variables and then assigns the results of the reservation to these variablesThe last part of holistic is the initial definitionThe output of each gun now includes three partsThe first part is conditional restrictionsSpecify the conditions that need to be met to use the current outputPart 2 is the result of the dialogue responseIt can use the template of the business parameter variety that we defined earlier to generate the number returnThe third part is the status updateIt specifies a new session state that our system should enter after the policy processing endsAt the same time, Taipei saves some parameters and provides subsequent wheels for useIn this dialogue example, we first judge whether the result of booking a hotel is 1, that is, whether the booking is successfulIf the reservation is successful, return the corresponding Huashu and specify that the current dialogue status needs to be updated to 003Okay, just now we introduced how a single policy is definedHow did the water leak in Martell&#39;s actual operation come from the zodiac?Let&#39;s take a look at the mp and service architectureThe core of Tiance is a dialogue management engineThe dialog flow of each skill on this engine is defined by a cone leftover file. This default file actually includes a series of policies.During the operation of Dimple, each request will first access the skills configured in the cloud to obtain the analysis resultsThen according to the process ID and the mp of the analysis result, find the corresponding bubble water in the file of the corresponding skill and execute it.In addition, we introduced earlier that the parameters of the function type can be defined in Hou Le ShuiThe function here needs to be defined and implemented in the programDianpei has built-in some commonly used functions as shared functions, including the operation of requesting external services to parse dataAll skills can be called directlyAt the same time, developers can also implement destined functions and call them according to actual business needsBelow we introduce in detail the configuration structure and usage method of the subversive landThe code of Dianchi is open source and hosted on githubIn actual use, developers can realize most of the dialogue process management through configurationThe configuration files of gmp are all in the conf directory of the codeA file viewed from top to bottom is high talking 7 o’clock spawnedDevelopers can put the API key and Secret key corresponding to the cloud skills in this fileIn this way, you don&#39;t need to bring token when requesting dmpThe demo is the Polo water configuration file of the two login scenarios we providedEach scene corresponds to the policy configuration where the file is actually loaded by tmpThe file will be introduced laterThe presentation file is used to design the corresponding crack configuration fileEach skill needs to be cracked when the corresponding skill ID and policy file path are actually accessed in this file in order to be loaded and executed correctlyThe remote services push file is used to configure the external service address that the DNS service needs to access, including because the original address and the third party service address need to be registered in this file to be accessed normallyThe last france.com file is mainly to configure the service port request path of DNS and the setting of the number of concurrency.No need to change under normal circumstancesThe core of the configuration of point P is the configuration of policyEach skill needs to be configured with a cone leftover file. The default file includes a series of arrays composed of lavishThe configuration syntax of each characteristic element in the array needs to follow the arduous definition of the specificationIt mainly includes the third part of the trigger condition business warehousing that we introduced earlier has enteredHere we list the main field descriptionsZhengzhou&#39;s introduction, you can log in to our official Haben reference detailed documentationDevelopers can realize a skill planning and management ability by writing characteristic configurations according to the actual dialogue logicFor some dialog logic that requires special processing or access to external services, it can be implemented by defining the parameters of the function typeAfter editing Wang Jing’s cracked file, we also need to register this file and the corresponding process ID in the configuration file of Runway Danger.In addition, developers can add the API key and Secret QQ car of the skill to the configuration file of buttocksIn this way, the Dianpei cloud area will automatically obtain access_token when communicatingAfter the previously edited crack file and registration is completed, how do we test the effect of this skill?First of all, we need to download the code of Dianpei from bottom to top and complete the compilationAnd after the completion, replace the configuration file in the one-page betting directory of the screen with the configuration file we edited and run before, and then you can run the monitor PeterThe service in Yantai began to be modified through the partial file that is not as follows. This file configuration includes the port and path of the service request.In general, we can use the default configurationAfter Tianpu is running, we can access the service interface of Dianpei to test the dialogue.The interface protocol of the TV is compatible with the dialogue interface protocol of Voice Tuning 2.0Developers can access the nk service normally after assembling non-parameter data according to the companyIn addition, we also provide a Python script that users can run this script to simulate and interact with the local arranged service.Of course, the premise of our operations is that we have the original skills that have been trained and can operate normally.Finally, let&#39;s introduce the visual configuration tool of DianfangEarlier we introduced how to shoot this head to understand the management of the dialogue processEditing and designing the planning process through visual tools based on the state of the complex dialogueFor the visualization tool here, we use the open source Nga to link up and include the following four stepsThe first step is to edit the dialog flow in accordance with the pre-defined editing rules on the .lt websiteAfter editing the dialogue process of the telegram, we export the dialogue flow chart as an xml file and place it in the configuration directory of tmp likeEarlier we saw that the xml file of the demo scene was edited and exported through this toolStep 3 Generate verification configuration fileamc provides a conversion scriptDevelopers run the more expensive compiler directory to make dot py program. This program will convert the xml file into the corresponding push fileFinally, follow the same process as the previous one to register the file and the corresponding skill ID to load and execute the mpa that can be run.When visualizing the editing dialogue process, we need to follow certain editing rulesThis wargame rule is actually very simple. We define the following composition elementsThe first is the single arrow connectionIt is used to connect other elements to indicate state jumpThe second element is an ellipseIf the user experience it is used to store the user’s dialogue intention and resignationThe cracked version pushed to the front is actually the trigger condition of the policyThe third one is a rounded rectangleIt is used to indicate that parameters and responses can be defined in multiple nodesThe most difficult to crack grammar shows the cracked business parameters and outputThe last one is LingxiIndicates conditional judgmentBut when different drop conditions are met, different output decisions are enteredTo crack the law means that there is another conditional restrictionUsing the above several composition elements, we can edit a complete dialogue flow chartFor example, this is the complete planning flowchart for hotel reservations that we introduced in the previous chapterFor the detailed key steps of this history, you can refer to the course content of the previous third.OKThe above is all the content of this lessonthank you all</seg>

<seg id=10>Political struggle in the workplace is a hot topicWe have often talked about those who are all correct readers of state-owned enterprises, but many friends asked me if your foreign companies can&#39;t do it. They also scolded Steve Jobs when he was started by the company&#39;s management. Even the founder of a company can When the management of this company went there, we can see that you, a foreign state-owned enterprise with political struggles, are worse than anything else.Then I think it will name your righteous struggle. He has the most basic premise that the company’s management position, the board of directors, serves the company’s board of directors, and that is the owner of the company.For other owners, the most important thing for a company is profitability. In fact, you don’t recognize illegality.So under certain prerequisites, his struggle basically followed some of these rulesIt’s a bit different from the beginning. If other management is given, it is responsible to the government department represented by the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission.What this government department requires is not just profitability. It should care about whether your company promotes social harmony and stability, but not the employment rate of the society, especially the employment of the seven aunts and eight aunts of certain leaders SituationHe is more complicatedTherefore, the form of the positive struggle you give to foreign companies is completely different from that of the state, mainly because of the difference in ownership.We Chinese people don’t like struggle. When we talk about struggle, we think of some dark, dirty, mean and long methods.For example, if you think that fighting in the dark, sitting on the mountain and watching the tiger fighting, you describe the struggle as the first episode and it&#39;s not visible.The Chinese philosophy of life is also not recommended for you to read it. Instead, it is recommended to adopt a wise and safe diet philosophy of forbearance and retreat.For example, you can bear to have children, such as taking a step back and elifThere are still many people who hang poems about a big yard in the study, as if they think they have a lot of cultural history.But such a philosophy of forbearance and retreat is very inconsistent with the spirit of modern corporate civilization.In modern commercial civilization, what we need is professional talentsWhat are professionals?Maybe you will think that I have done my own things and I am a professionalI tell you this idea is very naiveFor a professional, you have to be able to do your own thingThis is a basic premiseMore importantly, you have to fight for yourself the threshold that allows you to do this.First of all, if you don’t have the ability to fight for the right to do things, you will oust when you haven’t had a chance to use your ability.So for a professional, you must not only have the ability to meet the responsibilities of your job, but also have the ability to fight for yourself the right to do this thing. In addition, you must also have the ability to fight for yourself to meet the efforts you have made. Of these memoriesIf you do not have the ability to do these things, then your leader will think you are a person with insufficient comprehensive abilityI am here to cite a lot of misunderstandings about the struggle in the workplace.The first misunderstanding is that we don’t need to move when doing businessThis kind of idea is very silly and naive. It is also a common idea of many diligent business peopleEven if I do my own business well, I don’t have to engage in those open and secret fights, and I’m safe.I can simply take care of the ice cream in front of my door. I don’t want to watch the fireBut many people will complain about itBecause he found that he is very professional but whatAnd he was accused of doing some assistant workSo he began to feel that his talents were not met, and he began to feel that his aura was not in line with this company.At that time, I thought it was very strange. You insisted on your outstanding business ability. Why don’t you ask yourself to fight for a stage?Why not fight for yourself a platform to use your abilitiesHere I have to give an example of a woman I admire very muchThis is the one we just saw, that is, he is an ad copywriter among American TV madmenWell, this woman turned out to be a secretary because in the 1960s in the United States, there was still a common pricing in the United Kingdom. Many women came out to work and could only do such junior positions as secretaries.But the talented woman here put forward some very thoughtful advertising ideas when he was in the position of secretary, and then he got a client with independent advertising ideas.After doing this, has the company promoted her and raised her salary?noThis is normal because every boss is selfishIf you can do an advertising copy job for me with a salary as a secretaryIsn&#39;t it bumped?But this woman is not willing to be bullied like thisHe found his leader and told him that I have two 19. First, you have to change my title to ad copy. Second, I want to have my own office like other ad copy.His request was metWe might as well imagine what would happen if he didn’t make these two requests or was sitting on the secretary’s child in front of the supervisor at the door. They said he was holding the water they said.He will certainly be unsatisfied, and he will certainly blame othersWill there be an ad creative exclusion on a regular basis?Will his talents be buried because he is resentful and scolds his creative passion and being suppressed?If he doesn’t know how to fight for his own power, his talent suppresses the company and the loss of a talented ad copy is actually a result of losing both.From such a case, if you are good at fighting for your own interests, being good at fighting for your position is actually beneficial to the company&#39;s interests.Then I will talk about the second common misunderstanding of political struggles in the workplace, which is to give me a title and give me a punch. This idea is also very silly and naive.We often meet some business card believers outside who are the general manager, the president and even the director.I chatted with him and found that this person does not have human rights or financial rights. I know he can’t be interviewed by a reporter because the headquarters does not allow him to express any opinions to the media.Can only distribute those places that the headquarters asked him to distribute, can&#39;t make any other explanationsSuch a life has this title. In fact, what he does is the job of a very ordinary business manager.This kind of thing aboundsThen I can give me a very familiar industry is the best night to tell you something similar.Let’s take a look at the covers of these exquisite fashion magazines. Do you know who ordered these covers?Which female celebrity can be on this cover? Which motorcycle can be on this cover? Who should decide this?ThisSomeone once said that the edited beiI can tell you that many editors do not have this permission to shoot the coverBecause there is always someone higher than him who will tell him that you can’t shoot well, I’ll help you.But here comes the problem. The person above me helped you shoot the cover and the magazine was not well shot. Who will bear the responsibility?If you are still the female editor-in-chief enjoying this title for a day, you have to assume the responsibility of the British team for this title.Why do you find this responsibilityThen your general manager will say why don’t you fight for this authority?So if you call again at this time and say I was treated unfairlyWill anyone think that your comprehensive ability is not enough? Give someone a title but you are not able to obtain a corresponding authority. This is your own problem.In fact, a recent news incident also said that this problem is the grievance struggle between Zhang Yimou and Zhang Weiping’s hometown.The chief director will think that I don’t want to arrange this sex scene. Your investors impressed me with this program. It’s unfair to me.This is the problem of some directors’ control over a project, but it’s also very complicated.But this problem is the problem of all soilI always hope that this project can make more money, but your bottom line as the producer is that I cannot compromise the quality of this work.If you are a master trader, you do not have the ability to control other permissions and interfere with the quality of your product. It can only indicate that there is a problem with your own operating ability.This is my second misunderstandingThe third misunderstanding of this struggle is that the struggle is all conspiracy without Yang.In this case, I have to mention this Gongdou drama Zhen Huan which was very popular some time ago.In Zhen Huan’s biography, the main cause of these harem concubines fighting with each other is who slept with the emperor more often, and who can remove the child in the belly of the other concubine’s belly?I often say that it doesn’t matter if you did this thing, as long as the emperor believes that you did it.This is the vibration in a typical hostage environment. In a one-man environment, there can only be conspiracy, there can be no Yang, because there are no rules to follow.When a person is an emotional animal, he will changeIf other operations are implemented as a rule, everyone can only conspireSo what we advocate is to start in the layout of the western-style buildingWe are also very pleasantly surprised to see that many workplace struggles in China are slowly being vertical. For example, the Gome building was in the previous period, for example, the struggle between Haha Danen.Maybe someone would say that they also have pubic hairThat can only show that we are not so perfect in the construction of some systems and regulations. Children have been through such constant struggles and constantly painted these regulations and systems.It can make the struggles in all our companies move from a sunny to an institutionalized. Only in this way can our entire society be more advanced.Finally, I want to talk about a misunderstanding about workplace struggles. All struggles are destruction and no construction.Let’s see that this makes them a representative of the Municipal People’s Congress and a member of the CPPCCThese two positions are actually a profession and it is still a big and important profession.And for them, although this profession is not full-time, at least he can be regarded as an angel nightThese two practitioners abide by the same rule, that is, I don’t abstain, I don’t vote veto, and I only vote yes.I was shocked when I saw the newsBecause I think they are pretty good-looking. My three-year-old daughter can also feel the sameCan I tell my daughter that you don’t move and wait for others to raise their hands.I think they may have forgotten this job, what is his job&#39;s job? The job&#39;s job is to speak for the people.Is the duty of this job to bring our society to a higher level?So from this perspective, they are actually dereliction of dutyThey are doing nothing, they should leave this postA workplace that we advocate is a political struggle, that is, we hope that through the struggle of each of us, we will put the rules to make our struggle to the sun.I have an American friend who told me you have to move you find because you are rightAppreciate his attitudeBecause I think that if each of us can read for what we think is right and put the right thing that each of us thinks is right on a bright table, then we find that what I think is correct he thinks he is incorrect. I think it&#39;s correct. I think it&#39;s incorrect.Then we put all of these opinions togetherThrough communication and compromise, we will formulate some more detailed rules so that the rights of each of us are fully respected for what everyone thinks is right. Our society, our company, and our industry will move towards a brighter future.So are you readyyou find because you are right</seg>
<seg id=11>Things in the world are difficult and easy, but if they are done, they are also easy. If not, they are easy.The above words should be familiar to everyoneI don’t know if our junior high school textbook is a relatively learned articleIs it difficult and simple to say a very simple truth to the world?You did it on the man’s side. It’s easier. If you don’t do it, the simpler will become more difficult.This is happening often around usSince childhood, how many dreams have been realized by you?At the 2010 World Expo, I saw such a story. Is there still a little girl? This little girl is called RyanHe is a sanitary corner where a construction waste was found in the communityIt is through his actions to turn this dead corner into a beautiful gardenActedPlant the flower pots at home in the dead corner of sanitationWhen he turned to take the second set, the flower was miserable by the teenagers in the communityDid not give up12 Planting flowers again and againIn the end, his actions were moved that those indifferent neighbors in Quli completed the construction plan for this beautiful garden with him.Wang Zou Next, every household in the entire community put flowers on the balcony, making this community a vibrant spring.I don’t know if you have any feelings when you watch this film. My feelings at the time are that this kind of thing will happen in our country, will it happen in my own community?After a good film, he took more than half a year in June 2011. I went to Shenzhen to do a giant project.I went to a very beautiful beach in Shenzhen, West Chong Beach in South AustraliaBecause this beach is a large beach that has not yet been fully commercialized, it is most used as a homestay.Local young people like to camp on the beach, and the one-kilometer-long line is full of tents.What kind of Chinese recording do we call it the 16th Camp of China?Turn on the lampWhen they leave, the camp will leave a lot of things.The one they left behindSome even buy horses with sandIt may make the people behind step on it.I hesitated when the swimmer reached this sightCan i still have itOne goes up and one instant noodle bowl goes downA bunch of cigarette butts come upI&#39;m going to swim and breathe half of the bowl of noodles and breathe three cigarette buttsUnable to swimI choose to walk away or choose to actI think of that little girl Ryan, I want to actI want tourists on the beach to clean up this beach with meObserving I found that there are a few teams on the beach that are winningI ran forward and beat the fireflies while observing the leaderThere is a girl who is dirty, don&#39;t forget somethingShould be a little bossI went up and took advantage of our Shanghai boys. Where can I pick up the bag?Help them put the bag in their drinking point and put it down, he thanked me thank you which one are youHe told me that it turns out that their home is not a unit, maybe it’s because netizens gather together.Not familiar withI said I’m not you, enlighten me, I’m a touristWow you sound so niceI have an identity today and I am a volunteerWhat forWhat I am more suitable for today is the volunteers recruiting volunteers in our cityWhat are you doingI said it’s fine for you to leave and all the trash is gone, but you don’t seem to be dirtyIs very bigCan you stay and join me for a one-hour volunteer operation to clean the beach?It may be inconvenient because we are eating right now. After eating, we have no time for training and our boss is not in the boss to contact the bus.I bet him if I win this picture, please follow me to pick up the trash. If this picture I said, I will pick up the trash alone.I don’t get up. His family is really willing to fight this with me.I’m just that everyone continues to be my target lock cylinder to know that I am a volunteer who doesn’t give up easilyI went back to where I live and brought a game that we developed ourselvesThe game here is called travel. We need to take care of the environment and low-carbon travel during travel.Just tell all of their companions that day, which boy, if he can not give me the problem of this game, I will enter you 480A boyBecause a special stage was used to make this pointThis aloneSaid their boss is hereThe boss will run down, can the boss help organize your teammates and leave us for an hour to make a circle actionBoss, I&#39;m really sorry, we really don&#39;t have timeStill refuseCan&#39;t say half an hourI&#39;m sorry that our bus has arrived and the air conditioner has been turned on15 minutes laterWill discuss with usAt this time, because of my constant efforts before, many of their companions have actually been moved.It’s only 15 minutes for a guy to jump outHis words touched everyone and made them all join me in the end.I don’t need his 15 minutes to allow 30 people to join me in picking up rubbish and they are also very happyI still have to be credited for 15 minutes of Shanghai’s featuresHow can I finish the long coastline in the houseThis time I am very different from beforeSee the pattern in the lower right cornerThere is a two-meter-high platform on it. There are 20 people who can scrape on the beach.I&#39;ll go up and talk about the aboveWho are youWe are allThere is a young man on this. I guess his English name is Jack because it fell from above.A girl next to him is not called rooms but also jumped downJust talk aboutThe two of us jumped on our upper body and looked at the 20 ones on the Internet. They were so embarrassed that they were eating melon seeds. They all came down one after another.50 people pick up garbage with meLater, the boss was special, we took a group photoThe event is overThis is me asking if the boss is not the boss. Today, we cut the garbage, will the beach be clean tomorrowMaybeI’m like this. We have a strong anti-Haidi behind him. It’s a gray wall. If we are doing an activity, this wall is made of environmentally friendly graffiti. We advocate that all people who come can abide by the protection of the beach. Take care of the environment. What are you inside?Great, our team is free from empty talkI&#39;ll send it to you, I&#39;ll fix it, and you&#39;ll fix itIs the result one month later?After 100 volunteers came back and talked about the 36-meter wallThe story is not over yet they played too highLater, they feel that the picture half a year ago is too subtleI later found a 50-meter strengthened meal and became friends with the hospital and took the garbage with me.Many people say that this is because we don’t use it. It’s too little touched.We often hear such words in our voluntary activitiesWhat keeps us newNo one supports me alone can&#39;t handle itNo one dares to be aloneLet&#39;s tell another story where we go to youThis circle is called Wang Yan, a 30-year-old ShanghaineseHe became our first batch of volunteers who smiled for 100 daysIt’s that we let volunteers go to poor mountainous areas to help children with his happy readingHe went to a very remote place in Guizhou where there is no carIt’s not good, very weak, I have to walk the mountain every dayWhen he had this idea, he told his family that he could imagine the opposition of his familyWatch videoWhen he went, he would really like to know if his mother supported him in the endAfter arriving in Guizhou, his mother actually couldn&#39;t let goMy mother’s friend told his mother that he is your luck. Your child does not have his own dream to be able to be like this. The hardship is my eldest son. All the roads have been arranged with him, but he is not happy. He finally got it. depressionWake up in one sentence, his mother and his mother will tell the prince that you are safe, what you like to do.Not only that, when he didn’t do it, many of his friends heard that she was going to volunteerThey made money in her card to recharge his mobile phone and told him that we can’t go and hope you will take us to have fun with the kidsAll opposition voices are constantly helping us to think about the true meaning of our actionsOthers know that others support it not because you are long and beautiful, but because you and the real meaning of your actionsIt makes your heart touched. The action that wants to save you proves that your direction is right. You will naturally have a lot of support.There is another situationIn the evening, this volunteer named Wu Haigang is an overseas Chinese in Malaysia10 years ago, he watched a public service advertisement on TV and told a story about teaching support in the west.Especially touchedHe said that I was going to Yunnan to be a support teacherAt that time he told his wife and her team about the ideaDon&#39;t toss yourself at this age to protect yourselfHe doesn’t know where to find such a word called channel, what does it say, wait a minuteFor 30 years he thinks I can&#39;t wait any longerTell me he said that I left the end of life is getting closer and closer I&#39;m waiting for friends can&#39;t waitStart simple last yearI told others that I have this dream and I am going to Yunnan to teach in Yunnan. Who can help me?I happened to have a friend who knew me introduced him to me, he found me and I wanted to sleepNot why you calledI said I need to go overseas but I think I am a ChineseI want to move my emigration to Yunnan to stay with him so that they can get a fair educationTalking deeply touched meIt’s not a good thing. I haven’t done a project, but if you touch me, I’ll help you.I found four other non-profit organizations for the school library, Ai Gong County Dandelion Library to use English to help studentsTogether with Brother Gang, we planned such a great training project called Smile 100 Days according to his needs.Let the children enter the ocean of books, continue to use the happy reading method to make the children really like the regular scriptThe teachers told us that you really helped the children and helped us alleviate the burdenI&#39;m very happy that the teachers are happy that the children are happierI tell this storyHave you noticed a common feature?When we have an idea but when we are ready to act, we actually have nothingNo one said that when I give you money, I didn’t say that we only follow you. He is our action.We know that action will bring us all the things we wantWang has something to say very wellHe said that there are a lot of new things in my life. It’s not you. I also go to Yunnan. The construction of the aristocracy is very smooth.51. I set off and found that I was like a positive magnet. All the resources rushed towards me.Today I am very happy to be the protagonist in two steps, please come to the sceneWelcome to Wangyan and GangHello everyoneThat I want to say I hope that each of us will find the bright path in our heart and start with firm stepsAnd tomorrow will become yesterday, grasp the presentlet us</seg>

<seg id=13>Let&#39;s start from the marriage relationshipAt a grand wedding, the bride’s mother said something very heartfelt to the bride and groom on the stageHe said that the two of you are from different places and have different living habits. Now that you form a family, then you have to know the number of people in the future. Hold your hand and grow old with your son. Then you must know that the true meaning of this marriage is to tolerate each other. 0.5 plus 0.5 equals how manyThe guest who will speak after you have finished speaking may be like listening to this. You will say that this experience of this marriage for many years has found the true meaning of marriage.But wait, is it true?Is true marriage equal to 0.5 plus 0.5 equals one?I was originally a complete 1If tolerance is due to this multiplying by 0.5, then in this society we don’t want marriage and we can live well, why should we enter marriage?Then our close relationship research tells you that 0.5 plus 0.5 is equal to the product of a process in which we regard marriage as the ultimate goal of old age together.If today we think that marriage is very important, the meaning is that I hope to get my happiness in marriage and get my growthSuch a good intimacy must be a raincoat for a familyIt’s not that this mother made no mistake at all because we have to face various differences in our region.Who said that men and women’s parents’ preparations are different from our generation, and we and our children are differentOne of women’s favorite games is a guessing gameAfter many years of marriage and life, it will be a major holiday, our birthday, and our husband will ask us what kind of gifts do you want this yearWe say whateverWe don&#39;t tell him because I want to be worseOur husband is often puzzled by style, he will always make mistakesWe feel very disappointed because the highest state of affection in our women’s minds is that I don’t say anything, you know it, that means you love meBut the man, this animal, is very strange that he doesn&#39;t have this kind of thinkingHe said you don’t say anything, how could I know that I’m not the roundworm in your stomachLife because of this difference in perennial marriagesI feel hurt because we think you don’t understand me so much. How can you do it like this? I think you don’t love me.Marriage becomes cold and tired, so the problem of difference must be solved by usHelp me do anthropology for myself. In fact, I think that Mr. Fei Xiaotong summarized a few words in ethnic studies when he was doing democracy research. I think this is the best interpretation of him.Calling a beautiful beautyHe proposed it when he was doing ethnology. His idea is that each nation has its own standard values and orientations.This value orientation and standards are often wrong or even disgusting in the eyes of another nationIn the early days that the group proposed, a strong nation would force another nation to change and adapt to me.In this process, ethnic conflicts continue to erupt, and there is no way to coexist harmoniously between people.At that time we will find that after many contacts of the nation, we will discover that your beauty and your value standards are different from mine, but he is also reasonable.This exchange Chinese will find that it is not only like this. One day, I found out that your dances and your religious beliefs are also what I will like.Then we continue to communicate with this further understanding, we defeated the mold and we began to appreciate the differenceWe find that the world has become so beautiful because of this difference and diversityThen we can truly realize the harmonious society proposed by our party leadershipUsed in family life is actually exactly the sameIt&#39;s just easier said than doneLet&#39;s talk about a few examplesMaybe everyone recognizes it as the actor of our most famous cheating incident last year.Used to be a very outstanding young man. His artistic talents are very good. Goodbye.His father Li Shuangjiang once mentioned his talent in Luyu’s appointment.I always hope that my child can grow up freely. I want him to have the energy of loveThat&#39;s why his book can perform so wellHe said that his mother often placed strict demands on him. I told him that you were wrong. The child can only develop well if he develops his art freely.When a lot of things happened one day than the other day, we still said in a swarm that Jiang was wrong because you were wrong, so he pitted you because you love your children too muchWe look back and thinkIsn’t it right for the three children to develop freely and give him room for development?We know that in the middle of a child’s growth process, we need to know what the rules are. Someone must tell him strictly what you should do. In fact, these rules are necessary.At the same time, he also needs another way to give him freedom to growThe same education is actually needed for a childSo it’s not that it’s always bad, and it’s not that you’re calling it must be badThe mobile terminal is not goodBut for children, he actually needs two kinds of educationThe two differences must coexist and cannot kill each other&#39;s mother and attack each otherThis is the idea of each being beautifulWe want it to exist because it has always existed for a reasonBut it’s really hard to do it. I find it hard to do it.From my own storyWhen my child was in elementary school, he took a mathematics test score when he came back. I saw that their school passed the 80-point test and the score line was not 20 points.Then I will tell the child that I love the baby. Let’s analyze why you are wrong. Is there any way to improve the explanation?It’s very pleasant. I think I’m doing very well.Because I&#39;m an expert in this field, I didn&#39;t criticize himI&#39;m back at this timeHe said mathematics is my specialty or show me him like thisWhy this question is wrongI’ve heard something wrong. Can you count it right? It’s definitely not counted as a mistake.He was 70 and you got 99 pointsIt&#39;s not enoughIt’s not that I also know that it’s wrong to say that the two of us are differentLet me see the effectAs a result, our children&#39;s math grades and understanding are going upHe said he thought it was right. Actually I didn’t do betterBut he needs methods, but perhaps more importantly, he needs confidenceSo I found that the beauty of the beauty means that in fact, other people’s differences are more different. It may be right.It’s like being in love is different from getting marriedBefore we got married, we found out that our husband is so generous. There are buddies and many friends. After we got married, we said why you don’t take care of your family. Why do you have so many outside things to do?Seven characteristics occur in different scenariosXiaoniaoyi listens to everything. You think it’s so beautiful and so special. After you’re married, you’ll find out how he can’t do everything and you have to rely on you. You’re tired.The same feature in different scenesThe beauty of beauty is to see the advantages moreIn fact, it is difficult for you to change this characteristic of a personWhen its advantages are long, this feature will happen more in the right field.Poor will bring more benefitsI have lived in the U.S. for a long timeThen, because I’m blind, the water is not good when he goes out. I know the traffic in the United States is very good, but I never even thought about driving.That he called a car is still a terrible thing at work in the U.S.Last year in October 2012, my husband and I went to Los Angeles for five daysCITIC has two days and he said he is going to San Francisco onceMy idea is really bad, just fly overHe said he was going to rent a car and drive overSeven hours from Los Angeles to San Francisco is 14 hours back and forthIt’s horrible for me to play back and forth for 14 hours in two daysI said but don’t go, I say now I’m goingBecause he accompanied me to the United States that time, he accompanied me to a meeting. If he was with me, then I should make a compromise, and then we would live in two cars and go on the road.I found out that the road from Los Angeles to San Francisco is so beautifulVery beautiful and gives me a special feelingIn the car, I believe that he also told me about his understanding of life in the United States. It turns out that there are some dreams. Your dreams are like this.If there is no my husband, there is no difference between him and me, using my life I will never try this way, I will never find that beautyBut because he was different from me, I started to have two worldsWhen we see the problem, there are two solutionsWe have two ways for your childrenWhen you see any problem, mom will say this is what you do, dad says you do it like thatOr it’s better to combine your two paths to see how to do it.Our lives are made special because of differences, special, beautiful, special and interestingThis is the beauty after the beauty of the moleAt this point, we will find that the true clean-up relationship is not to say that I can’t live without you.Still saying that I can live well without youI live better with you I feel better because of me you will be better tooAt this time, the positive energy of intimacy can be fully utilizedWe are only willing to deal with these differences if there is the energy of love in the intimate relationshipOnly in the close relationship that we continue to collide do we know that the original manifestation is here, and the compromise is here.Vietnamese beauty is here, the original harmonious relationship is thereWe live in this case and at the same time we use to feel the wonderful scenery of the other sideFrom today on, let us learn to respect him, enjoy the difference and experience the diverse and beautiful lifethanks</seg>
<seg id=14>Thought this is the best time this is the worst timeWhen you see Jiang Changjian, you know that this is the worst of the era. The mobility is obviously shrinking. You can see my figure and you know that this is the best era. The conference is very fluid.I want to answer what I just created, why is it Shanghai?To answer this question we have to go back to 170 years agoIt is a coincidence that after the signing of the Nanjing Treaty in 1843, after Xiamen in Shanghai became a store in China’s five trade portsShanghai has entered a rapid development channelThis year is 170 years since Shanghai has not openedWhen Shanghai was opened as a port, the powers of the countries began to come to Shanghai one after anotherOf course, the situation in Shanghai is different from that in Hong Kong. They established the so-called school concession in Shanghai.Renting him becomes a form of culture and a form of foreigners living in ShanghaiHe is closely linked to the development of Shanghai in 170 yearsLet’s briefly review the two stages of the development of this concessionWhat kind of living conditions did foreigners like when they came to Shanghai?Huayang DivisionThen you can’t live with foreignersBut in 1853 and 1855, because of the small knife society uprising, a large number of Chinese refugees began to flood into their homes.Therefore, the form of existence of monkhood has changed from the separation of Huayang to Huayang.Since then he has changed a historical change in Shanghai showing three trendsIs that its economy is very prosperousThere are a large number of Chinese and Western cultures in this concession, which slowly began to mergeTherefore, it is precisely because of this historical development trend that the historical and cultural features of Shanghai as a whole show such a few characteristics, which is probably six characters.He is called the center of the ballAccept the wind and rainHis thingNo. 3 Shanghai is a commercial society, so she was seriously injuredHe writesGenerally speaking, Shanghai’s culture is a citizen’s cultureIt’s a very down-to-earth form of such a popular cultureSo why did a group of Jin-style literati represented by the text in the first trial turn Shanghai’s culture into a Shanghai-style culture?Today, when we talk about Shanghai culture, we might think this is a complimentary idea.At that time it was a derogatory meaningSo Shanghai culture generally shows such a trendTherefore, it is precisely because of such a historical characteristic that its management form has become called ChinaThis is very interesting. It is said that in this area, foreigners are mainly foreigners who live as missiles. There are a large number of Chinese who have a living, but the Chinese government can’t control them.So in this house, he becomes a very interesting gray area and no one can control him.So in this area you can find all kinds of people who do different thingsFor example, here you can find some formerly light Iran, such as Xu Hongji, this Zeng Chuntian, and Zheng Xiaoxu.You can find the revolutionary Kang You who was ventilated by the Empress Dowager Cixi. You can also find the Su Bond who shocked the Chinese and foreign countries and took Zhang Taiyan here.Of course, the young man of the Chengdu show was born in Shanghai at the earliestIt was only later that he was invited by Cai Yuanpei to Beijing, where he moved to Beijing from Shanghai as the dean of literature at Peking University.This led to the birth of the May Fourth Movement, the new cultural movementAt the same time, the first congress of our Communist Party of China was also in our Luwan District in the French Concession.Hit you here today sundayIs the leader of Luwan DistrictYou think this is a place in the French Concession, so you can find all kinds of different political differences and political forces in the entire middle.At the same time, he has also begun to show a trend of vigorous development in various cultural thoughts and artistic development fields.You were talking about this technology just nowHe has always been that calligraphy and painting reviewI often say an example of Shanghai style paintingPeople from all over the country who wanted to achieve something in this conversation or say you want to make a lot of money must come to ShanghaiThere are two of the big three of Shanghai style painting, none of them is Shanghai, but one butt is ShanghaineseThe other two inconstants and Ren Bonian, one from Huzhou and the other from Samsung ShaoxingIn his old age, Wuchang said he has been living in SuzhouHe was thinking of selling paintings in Shanghai, but he thought it was a paradise for adventurers, and he didn’t dare to design it casually.He sent one of his students to be an attendant to Shanghai to explore the waySo sure enough, a year later, Zhao Yun is making a lot of moneyToday, you can see the paintings of his student in many auction housesIt can be said that the painting is shoddy and far from the teacherWe can also see Wuhufen’s very low evaluation of this person in Wu Hufan’s diary.But Wuchang said that seeing his students do not paint well, he can still make so much money in Shanghai.Therefore, under the kind invitation of his good friend Wang Yiting, the comprador of Nissin Company, he moved from Suzhou to Shanghai and started an important development trend of Shanghai style painting with Ren Bonian and Xugu.Therefore, there are not so many famous artists like Zhang Daqian and Liu Haisu who have come to the constant item in Shanghai without Shanghai.Similarly, we always say where is the birthplace of Chinese oil paintingJust in shanghaiWhy is the oil painting born in ShanghaiThis is because a large number of foreign missionaries came to Shanghai after the opening of the port. Now everyone sees the Catholic Church in Xujiahui.This Catholic church later became a called Tushanwan Guild Hall. It is now recognized that this is a cradle of Chinese painting.Today everyone heard that Tushanmen Guild Hall is a very nice name. It is Shi Shang and he is an orphanage.In order to let those lonely and helpless orphans grow up to be able to return to society, they can only have their own words. These missionaries from various European countries use art to enlighten their psychology and cultivate their future ability to rely on art. Such a craft that can survive in this societyToday we all know that some of the painters who graduated from this school are all populace. We can only say the famous sculptor Mr. Zhang ChongrenMr. Zhang Chuan is also the only Chinese artist who has caused great repercussions in Europe because the author of Ding Ding is a very good friend.Some people even say that the image of Ding Ding is a reference to Zhang ChongrenMr. Zhang Buy Nian is regarded as a master in France.His Mitterrand shot them all marked to take a photoSo it is said that she can come and go in your hands at will when she is in Paris in her later yearsThere is also Liu Haisu who is always called Zhou Jiang, so there is no Liu Haisu without Zhou Xiang.Without Liu Haisu, there is no such a career as the education of Chinese oil painting that Liu Haisu created later.Liu Haisu’s Shanghai Beauty Academy is the first in China to use the human body to sketch from lifeAt that time, it was unimaginable that a girl with her naked body was being talked about by a group of men in a classroomBut it is because of Shanghai that he can have such an open mind and such a mindset of being inclusive of all rivers, that makes Chinese painting, especially oil painting art, have made great progress.Let me talk about the golden songIn Beijing, we usually watch Beijing and go to Shanghai. People call the theater. Beijing people call the weather because Beijing people only pay attention to listening.However, after arriving in Shanghai today, it has become the so-called Shanghai Peking Opera.Let me give you an example. Of course, this artist is called a representative figure of Peking Opera.But I can say that there is no Shanghai and there is no such a long line of his entire art and can continue to influence all the people who love and listen to today.This person is called Mei LanfangMei Lanfang&#39;s first visit to Shanghai was in 1914 when he was 20 years oldAt that time, when Mei Lanfang arrived in Shanghai, he was an ordinary pinball actor who was unknown.He was the second generation official in his performance in ShanghaiThat top brand is called Wang FengqingYou can tell from the difference between his pack wins at the time that this barrier is strongBack then, Wang Fengqing’s package should be 45 days minus 45 days, and the package win was 3800. I didn’t see it. It’s only about 1,400.Then I heard the request repeatedly on the Internet and added 400 yuan, which is about 1,800 yuan.When Mei Lanfang came to Shanghai for the second time, Mei Lanfang was the top card. There were still more than 4000 to 5000. Dayang Wang Fengqing picked up about half of the original.So every time Mei Lanfang performed in Shanghai for the first time in 1914 was very important in his life.First of all, he thinks the Shanghai stage is very beautiful. In the past, the theater in Beijing was very dim, but when he went to Shanghai, he saw that the Shanghai stage was not big but very bright.Because of whatIf you look up again, there are generally very bright light bulbs. It seems to be the so-called red light or LED today.He thinks this is very good in such a novel wayAnd for the first time, I discovered that Shanghai’s economic stage is actually chasing lightThere are so many chasing lightsThe theater in Beijing vomited nothingHe thinks that the Shanghai actresses on stage have more votes than the northern actorsHe began to research and find out what the makeup method of eye circles is differentThe words of Beijing actors are very big, so when you are standing on the stage, the actor’s eyes are not big enough or enlightened enoughThe usual eye circles of Shanghai&#39;s representative actors are very dark and very dark. After the lights on the stage are illuminated, they look very bright and the eyes look very big.When I inquired, it was said that Shanghai&#39;s actresses had learned a lot from this Hollywood movie. This useful experienceHow many stickers for singing Peking operaThe actor&#39;s stickers in Beijing are all pasted with a square, and the face is very short and not good-lookingThis hairstyle is nothing Shanghai actor&#39;s patch is different from the northLater, I had no money to live on this stage for 40 years, and I specially summed up the four words called Gao before and after.Shanghainese are smartDifferent people have different face shapes in different ways of patchingIf this patch for a thinner person, then the back of the face will look biggerThis is a common one in the futureIf you have a fat face like me, then I&#39;ll go back almost one day the day beforeIf this is a short one, he will post a bit higher and shorterIf this point is longer, then he posted the next oneThis really didn&#39;t come to put a major trendTen days later, Mei Pai Art, his gentle and elegant on stage, his grace and generosity are inseparable from studying with Shanghai Peking Opera actors in Shanghai.But this is all appearanceWhat&#39;s more importantMore importantly, he learned that kind of innovative spirit in Shanghai, so that kind of innovative spirit brought great inspiration and shock to Mr. Mei.After returning to Beijing, I had no money, and I joined the so-called U.S. Party members around him. They also arranged a lot of new dramas, shot the Indonesian Ma Xiang Deng Xia Bone.So in Mei Lanfang’s life, innovation became an important main axis of his art.Therefore, at the end of his later life, the last play he rehearsed has also become the most unseen play, that is, Mu Guiying is in charge.It&#39;s from Henan Opera teacher Ma Jinfeng all the timeI can say that there is no Shanghai and there is no Mei Lanfang who later became a master of Peking operaSo today we are on the streets of Shanghai, what impresses us most is the many international buildings on the Bund.Among so many buildings, there is an dictation called HaThis art has only survived in Europe for more than 20 yearsShanghai is second only to Czechoslovakia in the world&#39;s most ahtingpu architectureWhy can a homeless man like Wu Da Ke find his place in Shanghai? This is the charm of ShanghaiShanghai&#39;s movies, Shanghai&#39;s dramas, Shanghai&#39;s popular songs are even more numerousSo whether it’s literary drama or other music, Shanghai will become such a big integrationHe can be the focus of a world’s attention so it doesn’t come out of thin airIn 170, Shanghai changed from a small thread along the coast to a magical capital that the whole world has attracted attention.In this, we can study his entire development processTherefore, Time Magazine commented on Shanghai once and said that Shanghai is the darling of the times, and it is a mixture of history.This is why Shanghai will present such a colorful thoughts in Shanghai, and will present so many colorful artists and artistic atmospheres.This is why the topic of my speech today is Shanghai</seg>
<seg id=15>Good evening, everybodyToday I’m communicating with you on a theme called a music I Love and I thinkThe former host has already introduced ideaInternet and what I meanToday, when the social network revolution breaks out, all industries in the world are being affectedIn fact, everyone inevitably has to face a choiceIn fact, there is no choice but we are the bestThe choice is to work hard or retreatIn a limited life, we can actually do very little keratin.It is very unlikely that we can avoid a lot of confusion, pain and sorrow.In addition to self-improvement, what else can help usIn fact, the Bodhisattva who went to Shangcang did indeed have a magic weapon for us human beings, which is music.Music is our true spiritual band-aidMusic is our only life-saving strawMusic never asks us what to ask for, but we can get power and confidence from musicMy soothing, comforting or healing caresMany times we may have an embarrassment that is difficult to express. We cannot say anything, but we can seek a listener who best meets our requirements in the music.It’s not so much that we listen to music as much as it is music that listens to usisaac i mean i am music music is meEvery human being is a born musician when he is born into this worldWe already have that month on our body that grows to the point where our throat is called the vocal cordsString together so that your activities are not just talking but singingSinging gives our spirits a new look and gives me a very specific direction for my day-to-day yearning.Let all our pain and IU become elusive, even the news that he is temporaryLet’s take a look with me today. I will bring you some videos to see how they perform in other people’s music.Because of the time limit, you can find these videos on this Indian website without going over the wall, so I will directly select some of them for you today.This is an advertisement from AppleThe key he gave us is simplicity is everythingWe humans don’t bring death or deathDidn&#39;t you say a word that I don&#39;t have no pocketsWe can&#39;t take anything with us before we can stay in this worldWhat to leaveActually learning music is learning AIThe process of learning English is learning how to loveWhen our nation, this society, this country’s music is full of music in every corner of the world, when music can be heard in the space of every family, our different opinions will bring us closer. Many quarrels can be relatively avoided.Many of our humanity shortcomings will be reducedIs music really that magical?YesWe often say that the end of language is the beginning of musicBefore humans had a language, there had been audio and music trips.The communication between each other in the primitive is to communicate with each other by making sounds and gestures of strokes. This is what we know according to what we know now.Today, everyone knows that I’m not a violinist from elementary school, but I want to tell you I love in a musicAs long as there is love, in fact, anything can be a way to express your wish, express your mood, express love, express great loveWhat am I performing for you todayEveryone may know that I will pull down the violin on this iPad that will be available in the futureSee how I pull itBecause every ordinary computer has a gyroscope called a gyroscope. According to this stable and difficult problem, the number one phone in India is produced.So this is a highly varied and advanced 17 definitely not less than people65 kinds of musical instruments, violin and celloDo I have to pull it out?Does form actually matter?unimportantThe key is that you can get happinessThis is the most critical rightDon&#39;t refuse to be happy because it&#39;s not easyThis is the unremitting efforts and struggle of many human genes through their creativityBring happiness to every human being on earth todayDon&#39;t refuse sexThis happiness comes into your own heart to make you really happyHow to startIt’s easier to be happy, my speech becomes a songToday we are here to hear so I also come to hear himHeard that we came to QingdaoHappy happy everyone has to be happyIsn’t it your dream to turn your words into a song anytime, anywhere?When you are a little embarrassed when you meet a stranger, if you take out this software, let&#39;s play it wellSo don&#39;t be afraid of progressThese things make our boring and poor life interestingLet our seemingly long and endless general notices can be embellished with emerging andLet me tell you about these two softwareThe software name is called three timesDoes it mean thumbs up?tsum bjm something is a music studio, it can be used by both professional and non-professional peopleThis software is very fun, the software is that speech becomes a song called three reactionsIt&#39;s a somg and then fyA word xongif fast handThis software was made by a graduate of Stanford University and his girlfriendWhat the two of them did is a software that did the same at the beginning and then later. In fact, it was a bank that turned into a sound engine.They worked as a joint company for 15 months. When they sold it together, they sold it to a public company and got $19 million.Actually, you think it’s very simple, but it’s not easy.Often an ID is an idea, an idea can change, not just your own life can change the earthIn the past few years, I have not performed many performances by myself, but I have done a lot of attempts and made a lot of creations.I put the material in Fu Le into the piano sound, the king of western musical instrumentsLet’s hear if there is a Buddha here.</seg>
<seg id=16>I just finished the filming of Spring in the TV series office or the role of the male secondMany people say that Crab just looks like you and also plays TV seriesRemember that they want to find a true actor and said that because of the president, they searched the Internet and called it the top 10 handsome presidents in China.I don’t know how it was judged, but do you know what kind of people are participating in the judging?Jack Ma, what is a pig, do you say that 20 of us are standing on the stage and he needs to be leveled?Of course, Jack Ma has a classic saying that he says that men’s wisdom and looks are usually inversely proportional.I think this sentence suits her too well, you know what you meanBecause he is the smartest man among the entrepreneurs around usToday, I will share with you my thoughts in lifeIs it lifeLife is a journeyThe human resources map will have an end point and the interesting thing is that the end point of all human beings is the same. You choose him or not, we all get that end point.When you reach the end, the great thing is to hang on the wallThe number of places on the wall in China is limited and Naruto has already been takenSo I think when you think of this kind of result, you really don’t have to chase you and you can’t let himWhat is most important in lifeI think it&#39;s his pastIn the course of life, we say that there is laughter, air, and of course wind and rainThe book says that a person’s life without wind and rain is incompleteI think in this sense, my Tang Jing must be much more complete than everyone here.You knowWe look at the whole time. I turn back the time to 1990, 24 years ago. At that time, Jun Tang was a graduate student of Nagoya University in Japan studying for his degree.He is here, I try not to mention the PhD in order to keep a low profileI was really dissatisfied with me in my supervisor&#39;s version of the creative article at the regular research results presentation again. Finally, he actually used such a sentence and said that Tang Jun, your research results can be brought back to you. China may be able to turn it into A paper but it is impossible in JapanThink about the IQ feeling of a weak mind at the timeI really can&#39;t bear it. I was angry. I threw the information in my hand on the table.I know I fell and gave me a choice, but I had to make a choiceWhat is this choiceI chose what my instructor chose for you. I have to leave Japan. What did I choose. I chose the acupuncture point that I have been studying for five years and six months.Many people will ask me if Tang Jun you regret the choice of the fall, is it regrettable?I have no regrets. It’s not that my choice made me walk into Microsoft and I have the presentIt’s not like that. After 20 years, the Itakura Fuminaka actually told me that I was his best student. Not that. The president of Nagoya University told me that I was an outstanding alumnus of Nagoya University.I don’t think I think the choice that time gave me a little bit of accuracy and a little bit of backbone in front of them.In order to make up for such a shortcoming, I studied a so-called on-the-job graduate student in the United States.Twenty years later, it has formed a huge network distribution in ChinaMany people criticize me and criticize meMany people say that Tang Jun is depressed?How to educateIt&#39;s a kind of anger, that&#39;s a kind of helplessnessWhat is depressedBefore the Spring Festival, I saw a relative’s child smoking in the toilet. I said that you are a junior high school student so young you smoke.His answer said that the Diaoyu Islands problem had not been resolved and he was very depressed.That’s a depressed feeling, how about education?Going back in time to 12 years ago today, I am already the president of Microsoft ChinaYou may have just opened the Internet at this timeWhat is the most used application on the Internet?Chat positiveAt that time, Microsoft had a chat tool called msm, and its market share was far ahead of that in China, which had such a little brother called Tencent&#39;s QQ.But I found that I found that the growth of QQ users is much higher than that of Microsoft MSN.And I found that Tencent has only one function that Microsoft&#39;s MSN does not haveWhat functionChat with strangers, you know the meaning of each functionI said that if our Microsoft company does not participate in this feature, we will definitely lose to the programAgain, why do you Chinese like to chat with strangersWhat is a human need?The needs of Chinese menThink about the mental quality that a man needs to chat with a strange man on the Internet all day longThe needs of both partiesFinally, Gates accepted my thoughts. The Chinese market alone will increase this function, but there is one condition.Microsoft China must promise to obtain 1.5 million US dollars of advertising on MSN in the next three years to cover development and maintenance costsWhat I face is that I need to make a choice but we preferNo choicegratefulWhy not get stuckBecause I care too much about Microsoft’s one just for me to give upWhat is the result of giving upI all know that amazon officially withdrew from the stage of history last yearI was thinking that if I chose China’s Internet pattern that time, there might be a big change. If I chose what I like, then maybe I don’t need to dismiss the get out of class.So what we say is that the splendor of life lies in constantly choosing because you don’t know the resultMany people will also say that Tang Jun, you have experienced so much, what is your biggest insightI think I&#39;m just daring to learnSomeone asked how you came here when you encountered setbacks when you encountered the most difficult time in your lifeWhat I want to share with you is that I have a so-called Don’t limit anti-stress methodThis reflects stress resistanceJust think about all the worst results, and when you think of this result, if you encounter such a worst resultCan you bear such a resultWe all know the network distribution before this year, I was thinking what was the worst result for me. The worst result must be my wife, yours, and me.Many people say that Tang Jun is still thinking of a woman at this timeIt&#39;s hard to be a man, it&#39;s even harder to be a good manThis is what I&#39;m thinking about because half of men&#39;s happiness comes from womenYou have thought that all the happiness without a woman comes from menThinking of this, I actually relaxThis is what I have chosen in my past life experience is a so-called bottom-line anti-stress method.We choose to hear that you don’t need courageI still want to say to those who came here to listen to me and their speeches, you really have a good taste</seg>
<seg id=17>I am a lawyerA friend asked me a few days ago what is the most impressive thing about you in the industry for more than ten yearsMu Ran looks back and enjoys it for himself. It turns out that it is not the case of the target senator or the first few questions in the Supreme People’s Court.Can you think of itIn fact, a case about 475 clubs and three centsA few years after I first entered this industry in 2005, I brought up a small caseMy client is from outsideRented out a residential house in our cityLater, he needed to check out early due to work transfer issuesIn other words, it is necessary to submit a request to the landlord to cancel the house lease contract in advanceIt&#39;s not a big dealMy client has a deposit at the landlord’s and both parties settle accountsNiconico should pick upIn the end, the landlord should refund my client 475 yuan, three cents.He said it&#39;s so simple that you have nothing to talk aboutBut at that time, the landlord was so crazy and tried to refuse to refund the 475 yuan for various reasons.The landlord thought, what&#39;s the great thing about you as a foreigner? Don&#39;t even think about taking it for more than 400 yuan.My client is willing to eat here, OK?The lawsuit filed with the court by directly entrusting a lawyer to the court brought him to the courtThis is something that mathematics finds ridiculous and so simple, and it needs to be litigated.What&#39;s really unexpected to you is that this landlord actually used local relationsIn the first instance, he didn’t need to refund the 475 yuanAnd the uncomfortable person does not feelThe lawyer who just entered the industry is a blowDoes it directly affect my judgment of my outlook on life and values?In any case, an appeal is to be filedAfter 20 courts, we tried our best to obtain evidence from multiple parties. Four rounds of negotiations and eight parties dealt with the final judgment.Finally asked him to refundBut can you think of it? It&#39;s really not that simpleThe smallest cases have entered the execution stageThe execution process is not complicatedThe judge called both parties and me to the office. Before everyone was on the scene, the landlord asked the landlord to take out 475 yuan in cash and gave it to my tutor on the spot.An unexpected thing happened the moment I left the houseWhen I was leaving the house, the landlord’s finger in the car held a missile between my nose and the shoulders of the person. Let’s walk and see.My thinking will stop at that momentIs 1 yuanAnyway, the other day I said that the reaction was running out of waterFortunately, I haven’t met this brother for so many years.I guess he should not be there today, otherwise it would be really troublesomeThis incident is not as simple as being dumbfounded in retrospectWhy is someone willing to break the rules of our society for 475 yuan? Just about to break the rules of a simple house lease contractIs this kind of psychological impulse inherent in us?China&#39;s reform and opening up for more than 30 years has indeed made significant progress and development in the construction of the rule of lawBut we often see some weird social phenomenaMany of my current services are institutional corporate clientsI find that when bosses often encounter problems and disputes, the first thing they think of is the mayor, director and dean Jin SanchangI often accompany my friends to visit these three because of my work.One day I accompanied a friend of mine to visit the president of our local Intermediate People’s CourtDuring the chat, I found that the 50-year-old dean of the accounting department who is known as one of the three leaders is not familiar with many of our current regulations and is accustomed to judging things by experience.So I gave the dean a printed copy of the land required by the current regulations on a certain matter.Unexpectedly, when the dean looked at this thing, you told me that it’s not a big deal and it’s not the way to revise it.At that time you can really understand what Simon bragsWhyWhy our current law enforcers and rulers often have rules and his existenceWhy do they often use rules and systems as their tools as their daughter-in-lawWhy do they not have such a sense of awe and admiration for the rules and systems in their heartsCould it be that the power that Xiao said was not locked in a cage?Many strange social phenomena are happening in the current societyWe just talked about the people who have power for the ruling party. Is it just for ordinary people like us who have no rights? Will they not violate the rules?Won&#39;t overtake the thunder pond for half a stepA very strange case occurred in the Northeast about 10 years agoThere is a school that organizes teachers to go out for a group tour during the summer vacationWhen the tourist bus drove to a certain rest area on the national highway, a water-saving water-saving hand-held knife rushed from under the carThis is a small water saving, but you are not too old and you are only 14 years old, but the dazzling knife in your hand is still shocking to everyone.At the end, from the rear of the car to the front of the car, everyone’s belongings were looted.Just when Robber Lin got out of the car, look at the door of the car. A young and beautiful teacher was wearing a string of wonderful vectors on his neck.New ecology, this vector that stretches out your hand is on the neckIt’s delicious today. There is one more period when the child wants to sexually assault himself, so he starts to resist instinctively.The two sides tore Teacher Ning&#39;s clothes during the negotiationYou are always anxious to pull a book at hand and slam it on the head of the robberWhat section of music are you wonderingAt this time, the more than 20 teachers in the car couldn&#39;t afford to fight and kick the little Jaffe who had lost the ability to resist.By the time the festival was sent to the police at the end, it was almost half dead, even if it was a breath.WhyThat is the existence of a rule that more than 20 people who can be called a teacher have completely ignoredThat is also the demonic nature released by more than 20 people. They have forgotten the existence of social rules and systems.Even forget that this is water saving and you have the right to be triedIs there no such feeling of awe and admiration for the rules and systems in the subconscious minds of our people?I think it willWe review the ideological and cultural history of the Chinese nation for more than 2,000 yearsDuring the Spring and Autumn and Warring States period more than 2500 years ago, our Chinese society was born at the same time as Confucianism, Taoism, Law, Mohism, and other important matters.But what I want to say today is the prevailing trend of social Chinese learning, but Chinese learning is by no means the same as RuxueLet’s talk about the Moffat family todayTalking about the understanding and respect of the rules and systems, etc. tens of thousandsWan Jia is a leader of two groups with very strict discipline.About 400 AD, the 4th generation heir of the giant during the Warring States Period did not live in Qin Guofu’s son and killed someoneAll should be put to deathBut the parents of King Qin Hui at that time were already old and ordered not to kill just such a son.However, the master said that there is no law that stipulates the actions of murderers who kill and injure people. This is a necessary method for prohibiting murder and transgression. This is in line with the righteousness of the world.So he decided to kill his son anywayThis story vividly shows that Wanjiao’s understanding of the rules and systems has reached a level of awe and even belief.Isn&#39;t this kind of spirit exactly what we need in a society under the rule of law?Isn&#39;t it even what we need for the management of Chinese enterprises now?But how did this spirit come fromI think we need to explore the core of Mohist thoughtFor more than 2000 years, the core of Wanjia’s thought has always been geniusDear thoughts emphasize that the monarch, father, son, brothers and sisters love each other on an equal basisUnder this simple concept of equality, the tens of thousands of people have a sense of respect and clearness for the rules and systems, which is what we now call a society under the rule of law.We can see that the philosophical thinking outside the shoulders gives an equal social concept. The equal social concept creates a social environment under the rule of law.But it is a pity that this important idea did not become the mainstream of society in the futureAbout 2000 years ago, during the Western Han Dynasty in China, a father and son named Dong Zhongshu and his master Han Wudi jointly launched a policy to abolish a hundred schools of Confucianism.Under the guidance of this policy, the society adheres to the feudal hierarchy of emperor, monarch, minister, father, son and sonThis idea is that society cannot learn from things such as scientific research society.This concept continues to this day and it is still interesting to participate in today’s Chinese society.We can see that there are some people who violate social rules and even illegal laws, but because of their special backgrounds and special identities, they get a special, including special supervision and management.Some people have special treatment when they appear in court because they have the background of official family members, including going out and clearing the scene when the police car clears the road near the scenic spot.Some people have special identitiesFind a girlfriend and go to the hotel to open a room, including being photographed by surveillance camerasLooking at our society, what we need more is the concept of free and equal rule of law, but it is hard-wonFortunately, the advent of the Internet era has given us a glimmer of hope and lightWe found that in the Internet society, everyone can de-identify, decentralize, and communicate on an equal footing.In the Internet society, people rely on a simple and useful rule to create a communityWe can communicate on an equal footing in a community of this kind of equalityI believe that the social system is so mighty. The tide of the society is also mighty and propelling us as a whole to find a society based on equality and freedom under the rule of law.</seg>
<seg id=18>Just now we talked about the application of Baidu Translate and how to use Baidu API. So what you may be very interested in is what is the technology behind the translation?Let’s talk about the technology behind Baidu Translation.Knowing the translation, we actually have to mention that he was born in 1946 when the world’s first computer was born.Only after the computer is a computer can we use the computer to translateIn fact, there was a genius scientist at the time. He was thinking about whether we can use computers to translate.In 1947, American scientists published a memorandum of translation that mentioned whether we can use computers for translation.In fact, machine translation is a cross-learning, but it not only needs to use computer knowledge, but also needs to use information theory, cognitive science, linguistics, etc.So from 17 years to now, it has been almost 70 years. During these 70 years, many machine translation methods have emerged.For example, at the beginning, rule-based machine translation belongs to rule-based machine translation. It means that we find some human linguists to perceive the phenomenological language rules of language and put it. Even if the node becomes a computer, the language can be translated.Think of this method. If we are translating in multiple languages, we need to find different linguist Lacey’s information, so the development cost is very high. Later, it is used less.In the 1980s, case-based translation methods emergedThe translation method following this recognition means that when we learn a language, we may not care much about your grammar.Then we can get this sense of language by reading a lot of reading or express the habit in the future. Fortunately, they will naturally have such a model during the establishment and translation.For example, if there is a sentence saying please bring me a glass of water, there is a corresponding English translationSo if we want to translate another sentence, please get me a pen, then as long as we replace the water with a pen and replace the corresponding walter in English with spray, then this sentence is also the same, so this is one of the main aspects of example-based machine translation. ThoughtAfter the 1990s, these scientists put forward the idea of statistical machine translation. This idea has been a mainstream translation method so far.The so-called statistical machine translation means that we use a large amount of bilingual data to build a translation model, and then the mathematical model I abstracted to establish the relationship between the source of origin and the target languageThen especially after the integration with the Internet, statistical machine translation has exerted great powerThe most mainstream research trend continued until 2014In 2014, the neural network machine translation method was proposed, but it has been a research hotspot so far, and the quality of translation teaching statistical machine translation has also been greatly improved.What needs to be mentioned here is that in the rule-based era, rule-based business translation software appeared in the mid to late 1970s.It turned out that a statistical Internet-based translation system appeared around 2006This represents two translation software in two different periodsSo in 2014, the coat mentioned earlier that neural network machine translation was still a product in the laboratory. If it is applied to industry, there is still a long way to go.For example, take your statistical machine translation as an example. It was all proposed in 1991, but the real large-scale translation system that was applied to the Internet was 15 years in the middle of 2006.So how long does it take to walk from the laboratory to the industry after the neural network machine translation was proposed in 14 years?In less than a year, Baidu has withdrawn from the world&#39;s first neural network translation systemThen in September 2016, Google and other companies also launched their own adaptive anti-systemI just mentioned that after the advent of the Internet, there will be a lot of data that can be used on the Internet.Now many people have mentioned a big data. For example, we can dig out the amount of translations of bookmarks and webpages from the Internet, and some authoritative 4.4 items on the order of tens of millions.At the same time, there will be some hot words meteor shower on the Internet, which need to be updated in time.These three are not bilingual corpora, not power dictionaries, and some Internet hot words and buzzwords constitute the main training data for one of our translations.On this basis, we obtained a high-quality response knowledge base through some noise removal and new detection and some processing.The translation needs of the Internet are actually diverse. For example, there is no response to poetry, translation needs of papers, translation needs of news, patent needs, and some chat needs, etc.But a translation system or model alone obviously cannot solve this problem, so Baidu Translate is actually a multi-special integrated translation system.For example, we have both rule-based methods, example-based methods, statistical methods, and the popular reflection methods based on neural networks.These methods complement each other&#39;s strengths and use their respective advantages to respond to different translation needs and ultimately produce high-quality translation resultsLet me briefly introduce the advantages of these methods.Streaming statistical machine translation just mentioned that statistical machine translation is based on a large amount of bilingual data training.For example, the left side of the above two squares is a bilingual data based on Chinese. The second is English. We will also introduce statistical machine translation because of the force. Then it is a sentence that has a one-to-one correspondence.On the right is pure English. We call him single and data. The one on the left is bilingual parallel data.Through some statistical analysis, we can build a preliminary translation model from the data on the left. For example, I can establish a correspondence between the words marked in blue and the words marked in red.For example, if I want to tell the phrase I will say in English, I will tell you can translate it into the right. These can be done automatically.In other words, through this bilingual text, we can establish the relationship between the source of origin and the target language, so the translation model is more like a bridge.The one on the right is a language model. The language model measures the smooth path of the target language after it is produced.For example, we can say that I am a student is a good expression that conforms to the habit of EnglishBut if it is grammatically wrongThe language model can tell that ms.beads student is more fluent and the score is higher.Through the translation model, it establishes a bridge role and language model. It measures the fluency of the target source and we can translateFor example, I have a new sentence here. I want to tell you a story that has never appeared in our training data. But these fragments have been like this.For example, I want to tell you that you translate into another translated idiom story. By combining the story, you can get the English translation tell your storyBut in actual application scenarios, there are actually some more complicated strategies in it.For example, the expression habit in Chinese is that the order of sentences is usually different from the order of English sentences. There is a debugging process.In the statistical machine translation tonight, you just said that it is based on a large amount of training corpus. We have a lot of training data in Chinese and English.But there are some very small ones, such as Chinese and Thai, Chinese and Japanese, Chinese and Korean. Their bilingual data is not very large or even very scarce.At this time, what do we do? Can we still use statistical machine translation methods for translation?That&#39;s for sureWe have proposed a translation method based on the Suzhou language. The so-called Suzhou language is actually the introduction of three other languages as a bridge.For example, we have a large amount of bilingual data in Chinese and English as well as business data in English and Thai. We can use the corresponding translation model in the grid component and the translation model between English and Taiwan.This intermediate English is used as a bridge to derive through some models, we can establish a translation model for Chinese and Thai, and thus can also realize a translation system for Chinese and Thai.So with such a technology, we can quickly expand Baidu Translator from two languages such as Chinese and English to 28 languages and more.Here is a brief introduction to the method of the car nobilityWhat is his strengthIt means that we can easily summarize some regular things and apply them to the translation system.Two examples are shown hereFor example, the beautiful font of a sentence is a date of September 28, 2015Taro, we usually express the expression of the year, month, and day. These Western countries usually express the expression of the month, day and year. Then we can adjust the time sequence of Chinese to a TV series that conforms to the English expression habits.The following example shows the response of a number such as 380, so we can easily write some rules how to translate 380 into correct EnglishSo this is a constant for the rule-based approachLet’s show you how Golden Power is usually good at translating some new phrases and Tottenham’s accustomed expression.Usually it’s something that we can’t say word by word to translate it is usually a translation of some meaningFor example, this is a popular sentence in the past two years. If you don’t die, you won’t die. So what happened?Obviously it is difficult to turn overLater, someone came up with a translation method. Of course, this translation was also included in a city in the United States.It’s very difficult to use any kind of translation methodAlthough we put it in our training dataIf we find such a sentence, we can directly type out its translation and present it to the user.This is an impact application scenario of the case-based methodIt is best to be a neural network machine translation that has emerged in the past two yearsThe same machine translation mentioned earlier, but when I see it actually cuts the language into different fragments. For example, I want to tell you to wait for such fragments.I just mentioned that when these fragments are combined into one article, there will be some adjustments to the sentences and some situations where the context is not visible.Then in the neural network machine translation, it does not have these problems. He will first carry out an overall coding in the Luyuan language, and go through the layers of iteration and abstraction of the neural network. Finally, the output will be questioned.This is like when people see us in the translation process to translate a sentence, usually by reading the sentence a little bit to get the overall information of the sentence and then translating the sentenceIn this way, we can make full use of the context of the sentence and the global information, and finally generate a text that is relatively complete and the order is more in line with the expression order of the target language.So this is the advantage of neural network machine translationAs mentioned earlier, neural network machine translation was actually just proposed in the laboratory in 2014.So after less than a year, May 20th, 2015, May 20th is a very good day. I released the world&#39;s first neural network machine translation system on the Internet. It is called namtv90 beef, for example, machine. translation started a large-scale application of a translation scene opened a new chapter in the large-scale application of AMGAs everyone knows, in September 2016, Google also released its own imc system.Since September 2016 until now, machine translation based on neural networks has always been a research hotspot and a hotspot of application.But in fact, we often encounter some problems when referring to a research from a laboratory to an industrial application.Statistical machine translation as an example, when it was just proposed in 1991, everyone was limited by the realization of the corpus machine model at that time, etc.It took 15 years to 2006 to have the world’s first Internet-based response system based on statistical methods.After the neural network translation method was proposed, then we conducted in-depth research on him from the efficiency data model and other aspects, and proposed a series of improvement methods to quickly apply it to our translation.Although here we simply list some innovative methods that we have proposed that are effectiveThese methods have been published at the highest level of international conferences in the text field, blowing oropharyngeal cancer to acml, etc.If you are interested, you can check it outHere I will briefly take one of them as an example to introduce to youThis is the nmd system based on multi-task learning that we proposed in 2015. What kind of problem does it solve? It also solves a translation problem in the minor language just mentioned.For example, we have a lot of data on Zhongying, but we have very little data on China, Thailand, China, Japan, China and South Korea.So can we come up with a method because the Chinese specialties are all interlinked. In the Chinese section, we all share a single encoder, different target terminals, and how to use different decoders?At the Chinese end, in the Yuanyuan section, we all share an encoderIn the target rotation, each target language corresponds to its own decoder, so this forms a one-to-many translationWe can translate into English, Korean, Thai, Japanese, etc. at the same timeTherefore, this work was later cited and used by a part14 people of the Women&#39;s Times Ping An. It was a landmark article.Similarly, in 2015, we also launched offline translation on the mobile terminal, that is, the mobile terminalFor example, when you travel, you often encounter network failure or high tariffs. If you download our offline package, you can also use our smp system to obtain high-quality translation services.We can talk about the storage resources and computing resources of your mobile phone on the mobile phone. We need to do some extra work to make this model run.For example, if we first compress this model 70 times, it only needs 30 MB of memory to run smoothly on the mobile phone.There are some dynamic loading algorithms and some vocabulary tailoring, etc.Through display optimization, we can easily call our imc system on the mobile phone. Now it supports Chinese, English, Japanese, Korean and other languages.The technology of Baidu Translation has been widely recognized by experts and scholars. For example, in 2014, Baidu Translation won the first prize of Science and Technology Progress of the Chinese Institute of Electronics, and the second prize of National Science and Technology Progress Award in 2015.The following list is a representative of our academic papers. You can search on the Internet. If you are interested, you can download it on the Internet.thank you all</seg>
<seg id=19>Two days ago, a male classmate called me to ask me, please add. I heard that you are going to give a speech on the 29th. Boys are rubbish.Think boys are really useless. Life is short. Will our girls still save them so hard?This call has a backgroundLast year our class organized a theme class that would save boysThe school is considered to be a good school. Our class is the class with the best grades in the whole year, but we often find these phenomenaIn the class activities, all the PPT work is girls, including the scripts of this event. Girls are always cleaning the class hygiene. The ones who persist in the end are also girls and boys. That’s long gone.The grades are often better for girlsThe majority of girls and teachers can’t help but feel deeply worried about where all our good boys have gone.I want to call the boys theme class will be released smoothlyEvery boy is under a lot of pressure and seems to take the initiative to talk about how he should be a good boy and talk about his plans for the futureThey also invited my dad to give a speech as a successful manOf course I don’t think he is such a successful personAs a successful person, he can set an example for boys and inspire everyoneGirls are just talking about the bones and bones. It can be said that the whole presentation condenses our girls’ ardent expectation and care for boys.After the conclusion, our girls and teachers agreed that this conference was a great successLater, we also held events such as the top ten best boys for girls&#39; votes. Let girls vote for good boys. How can they make up for boys?I heard that time is the best way to test emotional engagementSure enough, today, one year later, our girls are still working hard to make PPTLast August I participated in Ge&#39;s coming-of-age ceremonyDuring the season of raising Liu Huo, I and nearly 70 teenagers from across the country stepped onto the arm and embarked on the most difficult part of Xuanzang’s westward journey to learn Buddhist scriptures.88 kilometers to be completed in four daysAfter all, I have been a monitor for several years. After all, I have experienced a vigorous action to save boys. Therefore, I was mentally prepared to become a Gobi girl before the last time.When I was next door, I found that the number of boys facing physics is far more than girls, and the captain washing hands, etc. are all boys. I began to worry about my team.He is one of the thinnest boys in the team and our vanguard.Once we got a little lost and don&#39;t know how to go afterwardsAt this time, he took the initiative to ask Ying to ask me to find the wayIf you really get lost in a place like Gobi where Mo Huangsha is given, it’s not a jokeBut he is still on the roadWe were really excited when his thin figure appeared next to a certain boulder againLet them give us a good news, but when we walk back to noonI am deeply moved by his dedication to the team and his courageIs our captainWe are not fair to the more unique team captain at the time.That is, we chose the most stable and mature person to be the captainHe is our classmate Lin Feng. He is actually a shy person who doesn&#39;t like to talk.The longest job as long as it is a joy and pride that he has never experienced before, so he has to walk at the end of the team every day.He also needs to assist the team leader to take care of the wounded and remind the team members to replenish water in timeActing as a walkie-talkie, charging treasure, mobile medicine box, etc.The work is very tedious and tiring, but we never read the boss on his mature face.There are many more reforms than similar boy storiesAt that time they really became the manly images we girls expectedAt that time, our girls were at ease to do strict little roses and this was the best time for Gobi roses because we haven’t seen them yet.Let’s say there is a character. In super simple terms, a character refers to what a person thinks he is and what kind of behavior mode he has adopted.Xiao, an independent man with arms protected, imagined that these words, even a boy who had just set foot on the Gobi, could not help becoming a man.It’s the charm of a character that can change a person’s behavior patternHere is another question, why the tights and the captain can perform better in these menThere is also a secondary role positioning, an irreplaceable behavior called role positioningIn the Gobi, in our team, the role played by tight-fitting is not only a man, but also our pioneer. This role is only for him.52&#39;s jazz is his role positioningThe same is true for our captainMy role is the captain, so many things can only be done by him1525 can replace this is the role positioningBecause of the irreplaceable role positioning, we can turn outstanding into outstandingMy real squad leader’s life pressure should start from the sixth gradeAt that time, the monitor was asked to write a short section of the class every week, and then he got the training on the podium on Monday.When I was in sixth grade for the first time holding that flimsy classmate’s medalIt&#39;s as nervous as wearing a rabbitAt that time, I yelled to myself that you are the squad leader or the squad leaderI won&#39;t be nervous anymoreLater, when I was promoted, the amount of shift increased and the class work was completed every day. It was often late at night. At this time, I was facing a lot of homework.Some of the basic questions that have been done thousands of times in it, sometimes I really want to copy themWomen often stay up late and get oldDon&#39;t want to go so earlyBut whenever my eyes condition the answer, there is always a voice passing in my heart. You are the squad leader or the squad leader.How can I be sorry for the words squad leaderSo I frankly accepted the fact that I seemed to be getting old earlier than othersAt the time I didn’t know the concept of role positioning, but now that I think about it, this is indeed the charm of role positioning.A person walks on his path without complaint or regret, and will never be afraid of all new winds and rainsDo boys really need to be rescued?In my opinion, it is enough if we tell them that you are a man, a vanguard, and a captain.</seg>
<seg id=20>Hello everyoneToday I am very happy and honored to have the opportunity to share with you the science of beautyIt’s not beauty science, of course we have to talk about beautyAesthetics that cannot be applied to beautiful women are regarded as philosophy, so we have to get this thing rightTo me today, let’s divide it into two parts. The first part is beautiful, but where the science is. The second part talks about science in every science.November 25 is the most beautiful day for meWhy beautifulTwo reasonsOne reason is that Einstein published the theory of general relativity 100 years ago on this day, which is the most beautiful scientific theory for me.For another reason, everyone also saw my daughter who was born 25 years ago by the most beautiful girl in the world.My daughter’s beauty and general relativity tell me what are the commonalities between beautyWhat can be regular in thisThis is what I want to share with you todayIn other words, we have to ask a question what is beautyWell, in fact, these families have asked this question for more than 2,000 years. From the great philosopher Socrates to his student Plato and Lato’s student Aristotle to the current Kant Hegel and so on, this family has asked. this problemThis question is called a genius questioningSo let’s see what the answer is now after the family asked for more than two daysThen of course I plan to have a lot of categoriesLet’s select the views of estheticians on this issue summarized by Professor Zhu Liyuan of Fudan UniversityProfessor Wu said that I don’t think I can answer this question, but Plato said that beauty is male, so beauty is male.And I think it’s a very true saying for the input of renting a mobile phoneWhat is beauty every time a manI want to say that beauty is femaleIf we are in class when I teach, classmate An, for example, our classmate of An Elementary School today, then ask me a question, my respected professor, how high is the sun?Then I am from the school of astronomy to ask this question or it is correctI replied, my dear classmate, how real I amIn the knot, how many stars are there in the skyI&#39;ll come back again, N many N manyYou can remember that we have a beautiful woman Yang Yuying sings a song very similarIf I answer the question in the same way, I think classmate An will definitely cry and faint in the toilet when going out.So this is the typical answerIn my opinion what is beautyWhat is aestheticsBeauty is hardAs for what you think, I can&#39;t do it anywayWhyBecause it&#39;s not scientificWhy not scientificIt&#39;s not our habit to ask nonsenseThe bottom line is the emperor of the scientist, we have to answer this questionSo how do I think about this problemLuo thought about it for almost 30 yearsI want to use natural science methods to study aestheticsWe have a famous physicist, Mr. Peng Huanwu. He said that although the material world is ever-changing, it is very sincere. Under the same conditions, the same phenomenon will inevitably occur.Then I put Mr. Peng’s words on aesthetic researchWhat I want to say is that although the world of beauty is ever-changing, although there are various beauties present here are very different, there should be inherent laws.So if I do it concretely, then I will first start with the question from the left handTeacher Istan taught us that it’s not surprising that Yunsan taught us general relativity and also taught us scientific research methods.He said that raising a good problem is more important than solving a problemWhat is beautyI think this question can be rephrasedMy formulation means that Netease’s aesthetic objects can include everyone, including beauty, back, including food, my art, and the beauty of the water can include the science of beauty. What standards do they meet?In other words, what is the criterion for judging beauty in a broad sense?I transformed this questionIn other words, we can understand what is beautiful and what is beautiful when the criterion for judging beauty in a broad sense is determined.Of course, Netease Beauty’s standard of judgment is a little bit more. I call it the general rule of every rule, so I want to establish a general rule of beauty.So what about the specific approach?I am a three-stage method that respects the comparative standards of our natural science researchIf the money is not in the middle, then we specifically say we are a three-stage methodFirst of all, we have to summarizeWe need to take out all the different types of beauty according to usThen we have to regainIn other words, the crew should try their best to exhaustively list whether they have anything that we think beautiful violates our laws.If it’s violated, we have to modify the houseThen we have to falsifyWe have to find things that don’t conform to this rule.In this case, then I finally got the broad lawThe way to generalized beauty is beauty. One defect is not commonWe will feel beautiful if we meet these two conditionsNo money is pure valuesFor example, it is powerful, for example, it is natural, reasonable, complete, and sillyIt is common for the Chang&#39;an Ministry to refer to Bitcoin that is not as good as the sun.The man here is you. If you post any of the common items in my list to your girlfriend or your wife, I promise that he will not kill you and you will be stuck.So the judgment of beauty or not lies in this placeWhat is aestheticsWhy do we have different aestheticsCun Liguan is to judge the ability and values of beauty to judge whether there is a defect, and then our insight to judge whether it is uncommonTherefore, different values and our different insights have led to our different aesthetics.The same thing is indifferent, whoever thinks that there is no defect and is not common, whoever thinks it is beautifulWhen do you feel that it is not common to have no money, when do you feel that there is no moneyWhen did you find it common? You don’t feel tired if you think it’s normalTherefore, there is no appreciable beauty, no absolute beauty, no universal beauty, and no eternal beauty.Not always changingLet me give you an exampleThis is a lamp I made in my circle of friends yesterdayWe know that the weather in Beijing was very good a few days agoEveryone is in the blue sky and white clouds in their circle of friends one after anotherI wrote about the morning glow and white clouds yesterdayI said Zhou Xiang still sings blue sky or floating dolomite why no one said to buy it todayBecause the blue sky and white clouds have been around for a while, although there is still no time, it is not common anymore, so everyone doesn’t think it’s sold.Tell me gently in the smog when will you end your vacationAsked such a questionThen there is a bottle because my friend said that if a scientific professional sees this, he must be elevated. Then the scientist will sacrifice everyone’s health in order to verify each of his theories.I quickly answered that this is not the case with meI replied that I said my ass, hello, stayed in a panic, I would rather have a common blue sky than a healthy curveThen another friend went on to comment that this comment is more sensibleHe said that he hadn&#39;t seen the weather for a few days, but he was dissatisfied and missed the weather today.Said that making friends carelessly is the consequencefor exampleThis example is Mr. He Ze he is my mentorI didn’t tell me the autumn colors of Tsinghua Park, but they were all beautifulThis is what I posted in my circle of friends on November 22Two things happened on November 22ndOne thing is that a commemorative meeting was held at Tsinghua University to commemorate the 69th anniversary of the publication of important research results of my supervisor and Mr.Heyanzhong passed away a few years agoLet’s take a look at the little girl on the left in this photo, this little beautyPhoto of Mr. Tray when he was youngObviously a little beautyOn the right is a photo of my mentor and husband in their later yearsStill radiantThat’s why I said Mr. He’s high IQ, high face value and high moral characterSuch a beauty is the ultimate beautySimilarly, the beautiful scenery of autumn in Tsinghua Park. Are autumn colors good and not flawed because of the harvest season?When you see autumn scenery, you usually have a better natural environmentThe snow scene is also good. The first snow of the year is also good for a good year.There was a heavy snowfall in Beijing on November 20thBut of course these two things together are still flawlessMore importantly, it is not commonSeeking truth and learning scenery together is not commonThe school is early, crossed out, can’t stay to study, the school is late, the autumn colors are goneThe autumn scenery and snow scenery are the most beautiful togetherBecause it is an extreme that is not common in aestheticsSo on November 20th, everyone was online and in the circle of friends. Photos every dayThe reason is thisAnd the beauty with three highs is also extremely rare, so it is the ultimate beautyLet me give an example to show that it is the most beautiful without defects and uncommonLet’s talk about the beauty of scienceI talked about the science of beauty and made it clearTalk about the beauty of scienceWe know that scientific exploration is full of surprisesThe accident is of course the biggest uncommonI do astronomy research by myselfI use astronomy as an exampleWe know that most of the groundbreaking astronomy research is produced outsideI countedThere are about a dozen Nobel Prizes in Physics won by the Institute of Science and Technology, and only one of them has achieved results according to the plan.When it rains, I will only talk about one of them. Although I have listed so many, I will only talk about one.This is also related to beautiful womenThis is how Ms. Bell discovered the sales center for 10 years in 1967I want to see this little beauty, he is a photo from his research, a photo familiar to a graduate studentWhat he had to do at that time was to study the phenomenon of interstellar flicker.I accidentally discovered the time signal for the periodic arrival of shopping hereThe picture on the far right is from a meeting in Hawaii last summer this summer when I met Professor BellI also realized beforeWe chatted togetherWe see that what Bell wants is still brillianceYes, this is also a three-high beauty with good looks, high IQ and high moralsThree beauties moving together are my goddessLet’s show you some pictures that represent the beauty you think.The photo on the far left is a photo of a creature and a photo of Panjin steamed buns breaking outAnd the middle one is a photo of our fingers hurting and a soap bubbleIs a picture of a galaxy on the rightThese photos are beautiful and undesirable photosWhy beautifulThe phenomenon is natural, so it doesn’t appear to be invisible to the naked eye, so it’s not commonHe happens often but our eyes don’t see it, so after we saw it, we said it was a beautiful and undesirable photoExplain the problem againThe same goes for scientific photosLet’s talk about Anstein’s general theory of relativityWe know that I just talked about the most beautiful scientific theory of general relativity published by Einstein on November 25th 100 years ago.The general theory of relativity is of course based on Newton’s mechanics. We know that it was published in 1916 and 87.This theory looks very simple to us this yearHe promoted Galileo’s principle of inertia to Newton’s first and second laws and added Newton’s third law. This is Newton’s original and the law of universal gravitation is also Newton’s original.Then we can calculate Kepler&#39;s three lawsSo this is the substantive content of his theoryWhere is his lack of authority?He explained all the known observations and experimental phenomena at the timeOf course it is a complete beauty schoolThe unusual reaction here is a quantitative and scientific theory in human history.His correct language and the existence of Neptune, the positive language is the language, which was discovered after observationIt was the discovery of Neptune that thoroughly established the correctness of Newtonian mechanics as the first natural science theory.So from the point of view at the time, Newton’s theory of mechanics was already very beautiful. It was an uncommon mechanism for every defect at that time.But some people don’t think that this is EinsteinEinstein believed that Newton’s theory of gravity is flawed. The reaction is in two ways.The theory is flawedEinstein believed that the instantaneous effect in Newton&#39;s theory is anti-special relativitySo what is the nature of gravity?Useful learningEinstein deeply investigated the abnormal path of Mercury&#39;s perihelionHe thinks this cannot be explained by Newton’s theory of gravitySo he asked about the scope of Newton’s theory of gravity.This is two very big flaws for EinsteinTherefore, Einstein proposed the general theory of relativity, of course, to make up for the defects of Newton&#39;s theory.The theoretical aesthetic line is embodied in the essence of gravity is that mass causes the curvature of time and space.The curved space-time determines the movement of all matter, including the movement of light.The practical enzyme defect is reflected in the fact that it is more accurate under the weak gravitational field, which is similar to Newton’s theory under the strong gravitational field.Therefore, all the phenomena that Newton&#39;s theory can explain can be explained by generalized equality.Phenomenon that Newton’s theory cannot explain or where errors cannot be ignored. Generalized understanding can be used.Therefore, the general theory of physiognomy was not flawed when it was put forward by Laiyang.Then this theory also needs to be uncommon in order to meet the aesthetic management rules that are uncommon in aesthetics.Another flawless example. I just talked about his theory. The above is the essence of gravity. The above is used to make up for the calculation inaccuracy of Newton&#39;s theory.The most important point is the abnormal precession of Mercury&#39;s perihelionThis is completely incomprehensible in Newton&#39;s theoryIn the general theory of relativity, I will list this place for everyone. We can see that the accurate calculations have come to this result.To make up for a major flaw in Newton&#39;s theoryIt is not common in the broad sense that it is reflected in his first person who has established a deep connection between antimatter and time and space.I just said that Newton&#39;s theory was the first quantitative and systematic scientific theory at the time, and the theory of general relativity was the first theory that established a profound connection between matter and space-time. It was the first to reveal that the material world&#39;s space-time is essentially curved. Theory ofIt used to be straight and now it is curvedMoreover, this theory successfully predicted new types of celestial bodies and a series of new phenomena, including black holes, expansion of the universe, gravitational sky, no red gravitational waves, and a series of languages.In the end, most of the political theories were observedThere is still a small amount of hemp waiting to be confirmedGive everyone a simple exampleThis is where the gravitational filmmakers have verified the predictions of general relativityThe general theory of relativity predicts that when the rays of distant celestial bodies pass near the sun, they must be naturally selected by the rays of the sun’s gravitational field.Then it takes time to turn off the certificateIt was this observation that thoroughly established the superiority of the theory of general relativity over Newton&#39;s theory and made the theory of general relativity widely accepted at that time.Are there any flaws in the theory of general relativity today?If I say that it is the most beautiful scientific theory, of course we need to discuss whether it is flawed or notIn terms of practicality, you can say, oh, don’t understand you.It&#39;s not Einstein&#39;s wrong or rightIt&#39;s not sensible, you didn&#39;t learnAre there any flaws in theoryWe know that there are some problems that are not in harmony with quantum theoryIn the future, of course, we expect Professor Fat to solve this problemBut we don’t know if quantum theory is wrong or general relativity is wrong.A few questions. Enstein doesn’t believe in the black holes predicted by his own theory, but he thinks that nature might be able to avoid mentioning some points.Contemporary quantum physicists believe that quantum theory may be able to circumvent the 7-point problemNone of these efforts have been successful todayI have done research on 7 o’clock myselfThe results of my research show that there is actually no difference inside a black holeBut it doesn’t need new laws of natureJust need to understand and apply general relativityThis is a few years ago when I traveled back to the teacher Anslan, I would give this resultReally no flawsSo Einstein’s theory is still an uncommon and flawless machine in our opinion today.We are still looking forward to more general relativity predictions not longFor example, gravitational wavesNow the rumor in the scientific community may be true, so gravitational waves have been detected.If so, it must be a Nobel PrizeOf course, we are expecting that the uncommonness of this generalized language will bring us many surprises.Finally, let me talk about the driving force of social development and the nature of scientific and technological innovation.Let&#39;s use this aesthetic theory to explainThere is no universal beauty but diversityI have just said that there is vitality only when there is variety and beautyThere is no most beautiful, only more beautifulThe pursuit of more beauty is therefore the driving force for social developmentTechnological innovation, we all know that the purpose of doing homework is to make up for defects, while the purpose of scientific innovation is to discover the uncommonTherefore, my conclusion is that the driving force of social development and the essence of high-tech innovation is the pursuit of beauty.That&#39;s it for my report</seg>
<seg id=21>Hello everyoneToday, I will introduce you to the Rogue Fort system timeIs a product of BaiduThe themes of the catalog I introduced today will be divided into four main areasOne is to introduce our grandmother Baidu&#39;s backgroundAnother is that the scene I used has been analyzed by several cases so that when you can refer to the industryThen there is a brief introduction to the key features of our manager structure.First of all, let me introduce you to the shootThe origin of the name of apollo is due to the blood of the Laip computer, but it does not form the archway.apollo is a mpp based is an interactive one supports Sogou Sogou query that input libraryThen it is oriented to 100 TB to PB level and then mainly structured data. Then we support a response from milliseconds to seconds.Then he did not come to research and develop because of Uncle Baidu, and it has a wide range of applications inside Baidu.Then, if it is deployed internally, the largest business with more than 1,000 machines may already have 100 terabytes of attractions on your site.First of all, we may hear more about rtpWhen will you comeOpposite, as the name implies, is like online analysis and processing, seeking a concept one by oneThen there is a table below which is a distinction between rtp and rpTake a closer lookThen first of all, from an application-oriented perspective, TP is mainly for the processing of some daily transactions. Then my skin is for some scenarios that are more technically powerful, such as query analysis and decision-making.Then I visited the magic like, then rtp, but some batches of small queries, and then the online App is a more consistent aggregation of these scenes, such as drilling down the cliff.Then from the perspective of data volume, TP is generally a relatively small amount of data. Its order is to access the latest data, but the amount of data accessed by TPP is relatively large.There are multiple versions of Orlando because it has some historical data. It needs to be restored. The history does need to be analyzed.Then, in terms of data update and data organization, TP is generally focused on time and time.Then he said that the form of the group is mainly the requirements of some paradigms in the database fieldThen ofo may mainly be some batch updatesThe strategic needs for his single football update are very, very fewThen some of his output authors wrote about males, mainly some including information models, and these assisted models for those who analyze the sceneThe difference between online Haohaofan mainly focuses on a response timeMore emphasis is on the result of fast consumption and paymentOffline For example, when there are some reactionary analysis work, it does not emphasize the response time so much.Now let’s take a look at some commonly used systems in the night.Here are some of them a long time ago. Whether I come to the building or not is just monopolized by some commercial companies.In recent years, with the development of big data technology, especially the development of many communities, it can be seen that some open source products have appeared.Then there are some from me and YuanGoogle and Amazon have produced a round of external productspayload is a productThen, some of his basic positioning. Here are some positionings that are more betrayed by our design at the time.First, open a product that is always a product, and then it can be linearly expandedChemical deploymentIn fact, we took the picture. It is already online on Baidu Open Cloud. If you are even some users outside the company, you can try it if you want to go smoothly.There is also the high-availability of the auction house, and its high-performance and its performance. Our design goal should be 100,000 qps.Every scan per second should be 100 forbidden, which is an order of magnitude for the entire clusterThen we want to import the speed and the maximum speed of the entire cluster that can reach 27 meters per hour.After introducing the background of the filming, let’s introduce some of Pan Lu’s use of some scenes, and some of our internal cases in Baidu. There are some internal product lines. You can refer to a typical case in our country.It’s not to see if you have some similar scenes. If you need it, you can consider using PailongThe main thing in life scenarios is to perform statistical analysis on data.Then in detail, there may be two major scenariosYou always say that there is another kind of report that is my multi-dimensional analysisSo how did everyone do our product line before you took such a product?Waiting for a report, it may say that it only takes a timed task and then runs it regularly every day. After that, the final result is the final result and then imported white and heavy.Why is this the final result?Because I have problems when dealing with large amounts of data. There are some performance considerations that are not up to the requirements, and then it has to pour the final result.Then there are some that are possible after the result is finally obtained, then the user will query the user and then the most library will send an email or some other way to show the result.But there is a problemNo matter if you do timed tasks, you can go. There is another one, but you keep the final result from early to night. In your life, you will generate many tasks and it is easy to generate many tables in the purchase of creatures. These tasks and table maintenance costs Is very highAnd performance and efficiency may indeed not meet the requirements many timesChen Hong will just do itThen I analyzed it more. It was what we identified and supported, and there is no shortage of harming me to take some scenes.If but if you consider the realization, there may be some archways that can be consideredThe following is the main force used to write some product lines inside Baidu.First of all, the first brain is Baidu&#39;s statistics. They are used in report distribution.This makes her first. What is Baidu Statistics?Everyone may be clearerHe is a professional website analysis tool provided by BaiduWhat kind of scene is it in this scene?Pour once in five points and there are more than 300 watchesThe maximum amount of data on the day is about 1tb more than one, and then the qps of the query is the highest peak value per second to 2000Then, when we migrated from others to pyro before we used it, we changed from more than 220 machines to more than 50 of ours.Then the response time of the plane has changed from 60 milliseconds before to 30 milliseconds afterwards.This page is actually a screenshot of the report that Baidu stats a single interface on the pad.The rough meaning is to say that every day, from left to left, he also customizes some indicators of some pavi and some traffic analysis.Later, as long as you switch, you will feel that these reports will be generated regularly every dayNext, this is one of our applications in the field of multi-dimensional analysis is Baidu WaimaiBaidu Waimai has his own data platform. It can use the one we photographed.Then he is also more familiar with his classmates to analyze orders and business sales staff.Then his characteristics still say that my dimensions can be customizedMy love is like this. This is a typical scene with more analysis.Then you can arbitrarily specify the dimensions through you. You specify those dimensions and then you can generate the results of this analysis in real time.It’s very helpful to make decisions with the faces of classmates on them.Then the next one is a glutinous rice. The glutinous rice is ours. The inside of their glutinous rice is immediately the head of the product. It is also useful for our rehearsal balls.Then it contains more requirements for reports and some reports, and some requirements for analysis.Then he switched us from the previous minute level to our second level before using usThis is our introduction to some typical cases where there are scenes and some usesThen the next one. If it is in the future, if the students have your needs, you can consider whether you can use the row.Then, let’s briefly introduce some of the overall architecture and some of the key technical features.In this way, when everyone can use us, they can consider something to us. First of all, understand first and use us better.First, I took a picture of the overall structure. For the upper-level users, we just need him to have experience in the smog society before they can come to simple food. We, we, because we support the agreement to buy and buy.Then we are shooting, that is not divided into two to two percent with patellar fluidLet him be responsible for some metadata institute queries, analysis, analysis, pressure, and execution planning. This task is scheduled to complete these aspects.The mutated card means that the sharding of the data is responsible for the execution of our specific restrictive query and the specific scanning of the data. These are completed by the be two.What we want to say in this is that we have multiple IPs. Our consideration is to define that we support high availability of metadata.Between any self-confessed a lot of playing minus oneWe use the content protocol to achieve a high availability of restored dataAnd that is to say, when our pressure is relatively high, the performance can be evaluated, we can be level linear, and we can improve the high availability of our FB through the level of linear expansion.This is just a brief introduction to our home is betterDetailed entry, now we have the opportunity to communicate in detail in the futureThen, let’s come together and briefly introduce some of the characteristics of some of the technologies we took.For users, we only need to feel the experience so that we can because we support the purchase agreementThis is if there are a few more advantages to buying life insuranceIt means learning school is very low for usersThen, we are also very easy to be compatible with upper-level applications, for example, the user&#39;s program has nodes bc E and DBC to access us. It is easy and indeed compatible.Switching area means that the cost of user switching is very low. The cost of switching to the original system is very low.Then it&#39;s okay. Now we can easily dock some other tools that are very commonly used in the market. Then it is not as good as jeans, like qlik, which can be easily docked.Then we can directly use some uncomfortable related peripheral toolsRegarding the use of fat, some knowledge after the acquisition agreement is full, a person who has the experience of buying three mouths can easily use the archway.Hello, you have to play the acquisition, specify the machine port and then the user password can contact us to shootWhen the user sees 10 on the client, right? Sogou is connected to the future life. If you want to be a little bit, don’t think we are a server full of life.Then it’s so cool. I’ll gradually buy some saliva for the list of statements.Then the following is the core of this meat and another is the progress query of some import income of our roadThen the person at the bottom is a select three-port query. These are basically the same as the effect.Parallel database. For a large-scale database of my live Photos, first of all, we may want to emphasize our high availability.The first one mentioned to the person before how our metadata is highly available between C is a protocol to maintain the contentThen in terms of data, we do what you do with high availabilityThe first is to say that our data has multiple copies, and then we can achieve automatic supplementation and system balance between the copies.The following is a freehand introduction to some of the metadata of F1, which is a high-profile and highly available metadata in the MV.To us but don&#39;t want to expand nowThen I will introduce a very typical and very important data model in the recording. You must pay attention to this when you have a film.For example, if I don’t have such a picture that says that we have 5 columns of countries with time I, then click and consume.Then I was filming it. It’s from the district distribution united outside the nostalgiaIn the first three columns, there is a K grin and on both sides is a durianThen first send all the keys listed in the photo, and your underlying storage is in order. This orderly benefit brings me that I can quickly locate and find this case, so everyone should understand it.Then all K columns are unique in the internal storageIf multiple batches of thermal conductivity data are cracked, if Xiao Tong bought it, it will be automatically aggregated.Each external link of Pellet and Outflow Chain can mean that each extra nostalgia can specify an aggregation method, and the same buying durian will be automatically aggregated.Then here is an example. For example, the data of one day and one day may be imported more than 280 times in one day because one batch is poured into five points.Then 2280, if you don’t do aggregation, at least the same individual will produce at least 280 dataThen when you analyze and aggregate, you need to go back and output 280 from time to time.But when you take the shot, we will have already put your 28th head in advance when you are down. The speed at which you are asked to query and search will be very efficient.Let’s create a more detailed scenario. Suppose we have such a basic data represented by a quilt. There are three pieces of data in the performance.Then we used to export a batch of data and import it into this end, we become a turretThen these important dataHis and the previous same key will merge different ones, you can understandThen, in this case, there are still 4 pieces of data in such a result.The former nostalgia for men because of its aggregation method is a way of summing upWhat would he do to drinkThere is also a chain opened in the internal storage engine. There is another feature that says that our daily food viewFor example, to the left to the left to indicate the original data of our basic dataThen let you import it and we will generate a metal tableThen I said earlier that my photos are sorted by key, so his order will change a little.But if we add that we need such a scene that is the user, his query only contains the face of love here and his pvp is not concerned about time splitting and god splitting. At this time, we can borrow a picture to be a disciple and reduce it. Column ofFor example, we claim that there are only IP and pv in such a carton table.When the user comes to inquire, if he does not need to use the time to associate the province, even we can directly go for a drink and go to the lady so the speed will increase.Of course he has a shortcomingThis is what you do. After the baby is generated more, it needs to occupy more of the data space that affects part of the data.If we have a little trade-off in the production environment, it’s betterOne more sentence, he will add that this materialized view is automatically updated when you import it, and then automatically positioned and automatically selected when you query. This does not require the user to perform any additional probabilities.Here are some other important features of panel storageFirst of all, we are the knowledge transmission, of course, we also support good storage and we also real memoryWhat can be the benefit of refiningThe first one is that when you query, if you only include some of the columns but not all the columns, because the columns are stored, the data of each column is stored separately, so it will be small if you need to scan the description.In addition, when you put the data in each column together and the data format of each column is the same, it is convenient for us to compress when storing data, which reduces the storage space occupied by the amount of stored data.Paccarus is a real two-layer partitionThen what is a partition?This is for a large-scale processing system that will definitely distribute the data on multiple machines.There will be two partitionsCompared with the traditional one-level partition, what is our advantage?First of all, the two-layer partition of our Polo can easily isolate the old and the new academy.If we divide the new and new points, for example, in the first level partition, we use the time dimension to separate the data. In this way, new and new data will be imported into a new distracted first-level partition and then old. Data will stay in grandma&#39;s partitionThen he reduced a lot of historical data and made some unnecessary merges when storing our back-end program memory to reduce some of our underlying overheads.There is an expansion that simplifies the tableHow to say thisFor example, we have a commonly used hash partition on the first floor of the hot spring. If the number continued to increase in the past year, you would not hesitate to each one of you stabbed a hash partition and the amount of data continued to increase. When processing, you want to reduce the amount of each of your same data, then you can only increase the number of your partitionsBut for a kid, if you need to go, then you need to re-separate. You need this everyone is very high because you need to recalculate all the data.In the two-row partition, it doesn’t need it. When the amount of data continues to increase, I just need to create a new analysis when the episode is sprayed. Adjust the hash bucket based on the internal two-layer analysis. Just countSuch a closing sentence in Xiamen is an example of our two-level partitionGoing to you to see him in the dimension of time, he carried out a 17-layer bank partition, and then under each layer, he solved the hash partition and divided 32 heads.An example syntax example of a two-level partitionThen it also supports a concept of hierarchical storageWhat is the concept of hierarchical storage?Let’s say, for example, our servers now coexist with SSDs and home hard drives.On the one hand, we still want to take advantage of the high performance of SSD. On the other hand, because the capacity is still relatively small, we have to be afraid of the environment.But on the other hand, from the perspective of 6 out of our queries, because the data can be divided into new data and mouse drama, the probability of new data being queried is much higher than that of old branches.Then we can put the new data on the SSD and always put it on the keyboardBut if our labor is going to move the data, it will be very high.Hello, it supports automatic migration and movement of these data in SSD and front row timeNext, let’s talk about the execution aspect, how to be happy and some special cases.First of all, what we mentioned before is that Hello is an execution engine of mppWhat productAn acronym for massively parallel processingThis is the core of the 60 happy things that we are actually AshipanOn the other hand, we are performing support vectorizationThis is actually a very low-level oil painting when his vector is still executedIt has reduced some, mainly because it reduces the consumption of some chips, etc. Some pipelines are better, and branch predictions are better.Well, there is another one that is to say that we are for one because we are distributed knowledge and then we took a picture and also supported a commonly used wooden thoughtFor me, when sorting large-scale and large amounts of data, we perform a merge sort between multiple nodes.Then, the sorting is more wild and the performance is better.Then there is also the sorting of some tools and aunts in some big countries, and if your data volume is very large, it becomes uncertain. At this time, we support the placement of these data.Then when our execution and storage are very goodOne problem we often encounter is that when multiple users use the same cluster, their queries affect each other.There are different queries or different for the same user, and the gap between the import and the query and the query are mutually affected.WhyBecause the resources of the system are limitedHe sent a very big query but other products may be affectedAt this time, what we are talking about is to provide a complete set of resource isolation solutions to solve this problem.To put it simply, we support setting a certain priority for the job and then fall aloneThen ensure that they will not say between different queries because you have a very large query that takes away the resources of other queries, and then the identified product cannot be executed.Then we can’t implement cgroupsSuch a reasonable and detailed plan. We are still optimizing the latest version. At present, we are on the cloud. We will go abroad. The next version of the Legislative Council is better.I won&#39;t go into details hereXiamen is a brief introduction to usThen for the following introduction, I took an import and export functionWe now support a variety of import methods, such as your data, no matter where you put the data, for example, if you put it in it, it’s not enough.All of us can support the cause this is now imported into their systemThen for the household scene, that is, the user, we also support a multi-meter importing sodium atom zodiacI heard that the relative bezel of your atom is poured in. At this time, the user often meets this requirement in business, which can ensure that he is able to achieve this atomicity.Then exported us and imported it is similarIt also supports an export of multiple data sources and destinations. It supports a lot of storage and storage.Then I introduced some scenes in which I said that Photograph is an iOS App, which is partial to report analysis.In Macau, we also provide some of the stronger ones on Sogou for the scenes that called you to analyze, right? Some enhancements.First of all, we support what we need to say. It’s worth mentioning that we are Mr. Pan and support Trump, who also said that this person with analytical experience may feel that the gains will fall sharply, saying that you can charge things up when you calculate or your calculations. The ranking of Astro Boy is very high in terms of pictures, but the belly becomes very simple and efficient.Then, for example, let’s take an example. If the three people with the highest signing in the same department have not passed through the function, this is very difficult to achieve.In addition, our future is to improve an application system for usersWe just buy on the client side and then buy the side. You can easily make user adjustments. View our help documents. You don’t need to say. You only need to contact our server. You can easily view it with the server that completes the client linkage. Help informationIt’s the same as the reflection back in Hanfu and so on.I said you want to check the import help revealThis reduces the need for users to switch between different Baoluwenxing document help pages. These pages are very ghostly. When you use money, it will be very user-friendly and friendly.Here is a brief introduction to the content of HelloThe following are some of our open ones that we have now are some of our contact us contact informationFirst ask this Baidu Open, so the payload has been logged on to Baidu Baidu Open Cloud, and then this internal connection, you can learn more about some of our products and functions by creating the above.He can email us if he has any questionsthanks</seg>
