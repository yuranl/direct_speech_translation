<seg id=1>Good afternoon, everyone!We now have quite advanced Internet technology.We can easily send a joke, a picture, and a video to our friends and family.It's even if we send 10 Gs in a minute.But there's something hard to send.For example, you send a ten dollar to your, uh, American friend, and it'll be hard for you to try.This is because an asset like the United States dollar, it's not replicable, and its point-to-point transmission requires trust.So how does this trust work out in real life?In practical life, we rely on intermediary institutions such as Governments, banks and others.By these various intermediaries, they form the basis of the credibility of our societies.Most of the time, they work very well.So we call them the Almighty Intermediaries.But it's like there's a lot of problems in life.As mentioned earlier, cross-border remittances.It is not only inefficient but also costly.Today we'll buy a house, and tomorrow we'll have a lot of big brothers and sisters who care about you.Visible privacy leaked.So a lot of times we're talking about these middlemen, they're bad agents.Is it possible to use technology to optimize, or even to rebuild, the foundation of trust in this society?In August, a hacker named Nakamoto published a point-to-point electronic payment system.After the system was launched, it was favoured by various hacker organizations, as well as grey organizations such as the Gambling Organization, the Money Laundering Organization and others.The system is the bitcoin system.Bitcoin also increased by a million times in the last eight years.There's certainly a lot of speculation in there.But it is undeniable that Bitcoin has its core value.Let's take a look at the bitcoin transfer and the bank transfer. What's the difference?That bank transfer on the left is familiar to all of us.It relies on banks, the intermediary institution, to hold credit.At the same time, it depends on the bank to help it record its accounts.Just in account A, plus in account B, it's simpler.This bitcoin transfer on the right.It looks complicated. Let me give you a brief introduction.When A made a bitcoin transfer to B.This trading bitcoin system is transmitted to all bitcoin network nodes using the P2P network technology.All network nodes then apply a common algorithm to verify whether the transaction is valid.This validation results are also transmitted to all other nodes via P2P network technology.And then you're going to put it together, based on the results of this verification.It is about building consensus and generating credibility through algorithms.And then it depends on the network to account for it.Let every node on the network be recorded together.The biggest difference.You'll find that there's no need for an intermediary.That is why, in those two years, there were many financial institutions that would study the technology, which could have a destabilizing effect.That's what we're talking about, block chain technology.It consists mainly of five broad categories of technology.The P2P network technology just mentioned, as well as consensus algorithm technology and chain structure technology, and smart contracts, cryptography.These five technologies, it's not, it's not new, it actually existed many years ago.But when they come together, they form a magical chemical reaction that creates trust.It's like 10 years ago at Jobs, with a mobile phone and an iPod plus a browser, creating a magic iPhone.We've been working on third-party payment systems for so many years.We have re-invented a new block chain system by building up technology for more than a decade, combining the technical concepts of the block chain and the characteristics of the information systems of many of our business institutions in our reality.A database-based block chain system that we call TrustSQL.We believe that technology, such as block chains, is the basic connection technology that belongs to the bottom of that base.We have mentioned earlier the issue of many intermediaries if we combine this technologically credible technical capability with the block chain.Practical application solutions are developed for specific, problem-specific issues.Then we apply the application of these foundations to optimize and even solve the problem of mutual trust between our institutions and even enterprises.That would make collaboration between our agencies more credible, more efficient and less costly.This is how real value is maximized.So how exactly do I use this technology?Before we mentioned the block chain, many thought of Bitcoin, and some even thought it was finance.Today we're talking about something different.For example, our loved ones have been lost.Can we find him faster?We all know that there are many public search agencies now.But we are not aware of the problems that these agencies have with information verification entry, the problem with data security, the problem with data attribution, the problem with privacy protection, and so on.The result is that these institutions are not, in fact, so confident of each other.And that makes one of their institutions, in fact, a highly isolated information island.What's the problem?Let me give you an example.When our kids got lost.From the time the information is entered in the first node, to the second node, which usually takes hours.And in the process.It is likely that the child is walking through the second node of the broadcast area.And probably you've found it. They're all home for dinner.But the agencies are not really aware of this information.It is also looking for people everywhere, causing a great deal of waste of resources.April this year.We use the word "baby" to go home and the word "404" to find out.Using the shared account book solution of TrustSQL, a public interest tracing chain was built together.It can be recorded a little bit, it's common throughout the chain.The problem of evading this information island can be effectively avoided.Makes the search more efficient and more efficient and transparent.Uh, one thing happened right next to me.Half a month ago.I'm a high school classmate.He came to me in a hurry and said that his old man was missing.I remember the afternoon of August 14th.We helped him that evening, and we completed the verification and recording of the information.The next day at noon.My classmates were very happy to tell me.The elderly had found them, and he did not expect to be able to find them so soon.We didn't really think we'd be able to get it back so soon.Let's go check it out.Found out that the old man was found through a friend-to-friend ad.That's when we finished the information that night, we entered it from "Baby Home".This information was then immediately obtained from the search point of the micro-mail, and was broadcast using the ads of the community of friends of the micro-mail.The next of kin saw the ad and found the old man.So we got this old man back in a very fast time.Although this is a small case of tracing, we also find that it reflects the charisma of block chain technology.It can actually make our society worth, and it can make our society warmer.It's a small case.Actually, we can think of something bigger.There's a very famous social topic about how to prove your mother's your mother.That means it's quite sensational.That's when we made the chain of blocks, and it actually came to mind from the time we were born to the age of us.We have always been faced with this problem, and we are proving our existence, our growth, our capacity.Why?Because we've been working on the certificate, on the student certificate, on the birth certificate, and then on the property certificate.At the same time, in the course of this certification, we have found that we have spent a lot of time, that much money, and that we have had a lot of trouble.If we can use block-chain forensics and the application options for forensics, the data behind the certificates can be placed on a digital identity chain, which will be truly 100 per cent.After that, we'll only need one fingerprint, and we'll be able to transfer this data to our own personal certification.Is it the society of the future, and it won't appear again, how can it be proved that your mother is your mother?Besides, have you ever thought about the future of our society, where there is really no cash, what will it be like?In the first half of the year, a television drama was very hot and called " The Name of the People ".There was a Chief Zhao, who was arrested at the beginning of the operation and who was greedy of a hundred million dollars.When I saw it here.I was just thinking.If our future society can digitize all kinds of assets like cash, it can put them in the chain of blocks.Can our millennia of anti-corruption challenges also be effectively controlled by the ability to use blocks chains that cannot be tampered with and traceable?We have just spoken of a few cases, that is, three ideas.We will find another possibility for our future world because of the chain of blocks.It's like using a technology like this block chain to optimize the credit base of our society.It's like we built a house with wood and stones.We're building houses with steel bars and concrete.Maybe this block chain technology is the steel concrete we're looking for.It can make relations between people of our future, between institutions and institutions, and even between the State and the State, more harmonious and secure, and make our collaboration with them more efficient, transparent and more valuable to society.As long as we dare to break through our minds and try, we have a heart of integrity and warmth in our hearts.Then we can make this technology shine brightly.Thank you.</seg>
<seg id=2>Good evening, my friends!We're going to have a little talk today about why we shouldn't have transgenic technologies.So this is a very popular topic.Before that.Please cooperate with me and let us make a small choice.So we have two different foods now.One is genetically modified food, one is biotechnology food or food.All right, raise your hands with your friends who want to choose GM food.Well, I don't think I see a few hands.Well, please raise our hands with our friends who are willing to choose bio-food.Okay, I saw some hands, okay.Indeed, both genetically modified and biotechnological foods are the same foods.They're all foods made with the same technology.So with this friend.We must not blindly oppose genetically modified genes.So when some people thought that genetically modified food was a plot by the Americans to eat genetically modified food, he would gradually lose his fertility, and the Chinese would gradually become extinct.It's a conspiracy theory.So, in a situation like this, let's just think about it.It's actually a country like the United States, right? They all eat genetically modified.Why?Because there are more than 2,000 different genetically modified foods on the market, and in the United States there are no mandatory markers, so it's not necessary to write that it's genetically modified.So the people don't know what to say.So I thought.Americans are supposed to be the first to eat genetically modified people, because America is the first to make genetically modified people, right?So if that were the case, would the Americans have no fertility?Obviously not.Because it has been said that in order to oppose the American use of genetically modified food to wipe out the Chinese dragons, because we are the dragons' heirs, right?On the contrary.Then, in January of this year, the United States adopted China's unattended genetically modified anti-insect rice in China.What does that mean?This means that China's genetically modified anti-insect rice can then be eaten and sold in the United States.This so-called conspiracy theory is self-defeating.Ah, because the Americans themselves have introduced Chinese transgenic rice for consumption, right?So speaking, this is a very ridiculous and ridiculous thing to think about right now, isn't it?Why?Well, let's give you an example.I don't think our audience here is gonna like the high iron, right?High iron is China's pride.No one travels far away and does not want to ride in high iron, and no one is happy to enjoy high iron speed, convenience and comfort, right?But do you know that more than a hundred years ago, when the train had just entered China, the same was true?Look at this. There's a picture here, right?There's a bunch of people who say that the train destroyed China's “treath”, right?So, there's a movement like "Red-Red-Roy," right?So today, let's think about how ridiculous it is to take the railroad, to keep it alive.Maybe 20 more years.It's also ridiculous that we're now “reversely genetically modified, bouncing dragon species”.So, I guess.We shouldn't have done such a ridiculous thing.But maybe we'll think about it again. What's that called genetically modified, right?First of all, I'd like to introduce a concept. What's genetic?It's a piece of nucleotide with genetic functions, right? It's the simplest explanation.So what's a transgenic?What do you mean, genetically modified?Actually, it's genetically modified.We can understand it as a technology or as a process.So let's be simple.That is to say, a technology that transfers genes from one species to another, we call it “genetic modification”.Or say it.Genes from one species, it's transferred to another through a certain medium.It's also a genetically modified process, right, so one is a process, one is technology.So let's think about it.We're against the process or the technology, aren't we?So, of course, it needs some kind of medium, and we say it can go through natural hybrids, right, for genetic modification.So, in fact, human beings see this natural hybrid and produce a lot of new things.Humans also learn to do manual hybrids, right?So the modern biotechnology we use can also be genetically modified.So this genetically modified process is getting better and better, right?So this is what we're thinking from the technical point of view.So we can actually think about it in terms of process.So such a genetically modified process can actually take place between different individuals of the same species.But it can also happen between individuals of different species, right?So it's actually a genetic transfer process, of course it needs a medium, right?Well, because I'm this guy with the fever, right? I like to take pictures.So I often go to nature and see, hey, what different insects are, right, they do this medium, as a medium, in different species or between different flowers, to transgenerate.So that's natural genetically modified, huh?Now you can see that there's a map down there, and that's one thing God's been working on.Like what?We have a purple corn rod of this kind with a row of white corn rods next to it, right?Think about it if this purple corn pollen floats with the wind and floats over this white corn.What color do they make of corn sticks?Think about it.All right, black and white, purple and white. Good talk.Well, look at that.It's the corn rod that comes out of it.Obviously it's not the same as it used to be, and it changes more, right?So the genetically modified process, it's a creation mutation, right?Let our breeders have such an opportunity.So that's what we're talking about, this natural transgenic.So actually breeders want to get more of this genetic mutation.So that we can sift the best to breed and form good varieties.For example, improving its quality, improving its anti-insect resistance, improving its anti-pathological resistance, etc., ah.So actually, in the process of this mutation, we can use the rays, right, to make the mutation.For example, when you look at this picture we see, right, space breeding.Put our seeds on a rocket, send them into space, let the rays shoot, and then it mutates, and this can produce a mutation.And we can put different cells together, right, and they can create so-called cell hybrids, and they can produce mutations.But these variations, in fact, are random processes, and this is a work that can be accomplished over a longer period of time.So what we're talking about today, or what the public is talking about most about, is actually biotechnologically, right?Well, that's how it works.We can grow genetically modified papayas, right? And genetically modified cotton.So let's actually take a look at what this genetically modified process is like.As we've already said, it's a hybrid, so now it's too blind.Or artificial hybrids are more blind.So, what do we do if we want it to be very targeted and precise about the genes we want?So first we're looking for a "car," huh, like this one we call a particle, huh?So you can cut this particle open a little bit, right, and stick it to the piece that we need.Like one of our taxis, I take a cab, right, and then I put it in a fungus, huh?So it reproduces, from one to many.So it's going to have contact with that genetically modified cell that we need to transfer, right?So you can see in this process that the gene on the particle can be released into the cell, and that gene can drill into the cell core and integrate with the chromosome in this chromosome of our cells, right?Growing up into a different white and more damaged tissue, right?And then this more damaged tissue grows into a small seed, right, and this little seedling grows into a large seedling.So the seedlings contain genetically modified plants, so we make a genetically modified plant, right?So what you're saying about this process is consistent with our traditional goal.But it's faster, more precise, more efficient, ah.So let's take a look.Why shouldn't we be against genetically modified, huh?So everyone knows that it is a very, very serious task to ensure that all the people of the world are fed, right? Everyone is fed and fed.So look at this curve.This orange curve represents a trend in population growth.And the blue dotted line behind is two possibilities for food production.If we use high-tech technology, right, good use of land, then food may follow the same route.It is just enough to meet the growing needs of the human population.But if we don't use that kind of technology.Perhaps there will be a huge gap in our food, and if there is a gap, there will be real problems.So, Chinese, think about it.The Chinese word “food” actually consists of two parts.What's the name of a part?It's called eating, right?What's the other part?“Reverse”.Food security cannot be guaranteed.It's gonna cause chaos in this society, isn't it?Population growth is then a very, very big problem, putting enormous pressure on our food security.And that's what urbanization is all about.This process of infrastructure construction has also taken over a large amount of land, right?Look at this picture. It was taken 30 years ago somewhere in Shanghai.Right? Can anyone recognize this place?But 20 years later, almost the same picture was taken in the same place, and we came to recognize it.Do you know anyone?This is a picture 20 years later.Do we know each other?It looks like everyone knows each other. It's Pudong, right? It's Pudong, isn't it?So as we can see, much of the old good land is now turned into a road, right, and into a city.So this urbanization takes up a lot of land.Our country hopes to be able to preserve such a land of 1.8 billion.But so far it has been very, very difficult.In fact, we have a lot of problems ahead of us.For example, our resources are constantly scarce, and our global climate is volatile.Look at us like we're in Shanghai, you're in Shanghai, we're surrounded by a lot of water, but you probably know that Shanghai is an area where drinking water is scarce, right?That is why the scarcity of these resources poses a great deal of problems.If we are to increase food production, then we are going to make sure that everyone is fed.So what do we do?If we're going to increase production, can we expand the area of cultivated land?It's definitely not going to work in China. It's not going to work.So let's do this. We'll give it more pesticides, right? More fertilizer.Would you like to do that?Then go inside your bowl.You certainly don't want to do it, do you?So this road doesn't work in China either.Because the ecological environment of already farmland has been devastated, right?So the only thing we can do is make use of a very rich genetic resource and then combine our new biotechnology, including our genetically modified technology.So that we can produce more of this food at such a fast, accurate and efficient pace.As we have just mentioned, China sprays 2 million tons of pesticides every year in our farmlands.You can think of 2 million tons of pesticides, right?But now we can use an alternative technology, and we can use genetically modified insect-resistant rice.Look at this picture, right? It's genetically modified anti-insect rice. Right?And that normal, non-insect-resistant rice, right?In the absence of pesticides, you see the difference between them is very, very large, isn't it?So let's just say that our tradition wants to bring a useful gene like that white ball, right, to a better breed, and the traditional way is just that.But it takes a long time and is less accurate.So we are actually doing the same thing in the present way.But you can see that we can be more efficient, accurate and expand this method of crossing this reproductive barrier for genetically modified purposes, right?For example, we want this Hu Yang, a drought-resistant Hu Yang, to transfer its drought-resistant genes to rice, and it's obvious that we can't do it in a hybrid way.But we use biotechnology and I use genetically modified technology, and we can do that easily, right?So this genetically modified technology is really a very good technology.But maybe our friend will ask, say you're so good with this transgenic. Is there any other problem with it?So, actually, genetically modified as a new technology, it does have problems with it, right?Well, that's all we're gonna solve.You think it's the first thing that exists is that we call it "food for the people", right?Does it have food as a matter of food security, right? Does it cause problems, sickness, etc., right?So there's still what it's gonna do to the environment, right?Then other than that.So there are others that say, for example, we should label our genetically modified foods so that people have the right to know and choose, right?So there's a lot of options about whether the country's laws and regulations are going to do these things and so on.Actually.In our country, there is a very perfect statute governing this matter, isn't there?And, in other words, we transgenic any one of our GMs, and as it enters into the production of a commodity, it must make a rigorous assessment of the safety that it can sell and commercialize only when it is safe.So say it.International agencies believe that genetically modified foods, genetically modified products, are safe.The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) of the international community also believes that genetically modified products are safe and legitimate.Because it's genetically modified around the world, and it's done in this framework.Okay, so let's see, we just talked about transgenics, right? Why can't we oppose transgenics?So now, as Chinese, why should we not come to reverse our genes? Let's come and see.So the whole world's been genetically modified, right, almost 20 years.In the process.The area of such a genetically modified crop has expanded very rapidly, right, and now stands at 180 million hectares, and I've calculated an area of approximately 2.7 billion or 2.8 billion acres.Look at this green line, which is a green line that shows an overall area of genetically modified cultivation.The red blue line is an indication of the developed countries, right, of the area under cultivation.The red line is for developing countries.As you can see, developing countries have exceeded this area of cultivation in developed countries.But in such a situation, where the world is growing upwards, we in China are.You see, since 2002, we've ranked 4th, right, 5th, 6th, and now we're ranked 8th, right?That is why it is very inconsistent with the status of our country.Here's a set of data that you can come and see.So, in 2001, China ranked fourth, with the United States, Canada, Argentina, and so on.But after 2003, right, Brazil will outnumber us, and then by 2007, India will outnumber us, so we'll be sixth.It's a shame, huh?So India used to be an importer of cotton.Because it quoted the technology, it became an exporter of cotton, right?So China is already smaller than it is, and that's a lot smaller than it is, isn't it?And China has been in sixth place for many years, and many smaller countries are catching up with China.Then, in 2016, China will be in eighth place, and even Paraguay, Paraguay, Pakistan, will outnumber us, right?I was thinking about what kind of country Paraguay was after China for about 10 years.Then Paraguay was a very small country in South America, with a population of over 6 million, right?A country of 1.4 billion people and a country of 6 million people.Such a difference between them is very inconsistent, isn't it, in all respects, with the status of our country?So let us say it.Backwards, backsliding, huh?Because genetically modified is a technology that makes money, genetically modified is also a technologically high ground.If we do not occupy this high ground, others will surely do so.When we are still debating whether we should develop or not to use it.Many countries have quietly surpassed us.So this phenomenon, I think, is very, very serious.Food security was also a very important issue.Our country is now importing 100 million tons of food annually.100 million tons of food.What's the concept, huh?I calculated that each person, compared to the Chinese, imports 70 kilograms of food.What if they don't import us?Then we'll have a bigger problem than that, won't we?So if we don't develop.That's an opportunity to lose, isn't it?So we actually think about China's genetically modified production, and we had a great time.China's success in genetically modified cotton is not just the one that saved the cotton industry in China.And it makes the whole world feel so great. It's remarkable, isn't it?So when you think about the past, when our genetically modified papaya is not on the market, there's no way for farmers to deal with this virus, is there?But today we see their happy faces with anti-viral genetically modified cotton.This is when we feel how creative this technology is and how happy it is for us, right?So I think it is my hope that our technology will make our lives a better place.All right, thank you!</seg>
<seg id=3>Hello, everyone.I'm Chen Shauqi. I'm a musician from Hong Kong.I hope you can give me some applause.Yeah, it's actually my heart too.Because if I don't talk well later,At the very least, the sponsors can get some applause to cut back.Ah, the title of what I'm going to share with you today is "Creative History."It's actually me who's been walking all the way to the altar for the last 32 years.And then there's something about writing, and I'd like to share it with you.It'll be divided into four parts.The first part is the path of creation.That's what I've been doing from 1985 until now, trying to tell you who I am.The second part is that in addition to the creation of music, there are other artistic creations of my own, including photography, and then, uh, painting and so on.And the third part is some of the tools that I've used, some of the tools that I've used, some of the methods that I've done, and I'd like to share with you.And finally, it's an attitude of slow life and creativity.Ah, it's split into these parts.This is going to take a few more seconds.Because I've been here 32 years.Some of the people who saw my name today still think I'm a woman.Yeah, so I'll play it again.The first part: The path of creation.I'm a luckier man.In 1984, in 85, I was with two friends, Liu Yiddha and Huang Yiming, who were trying to combine a man's music.And then I asked myself to write them some lyrics.And then we'll go through it for about a year or two.He did a lot of demo and a lot of little things and sent them to all the big, big, big record companies.And soon they were also admired by that record company, and signed to become artists under the flag.And then we changed our name to "Daming One."And then there was the song, the lyrics, the music, the music, the music, the music, the music, the music, the music, the music, the music, the music, the music, the music, the music, the music, the music, the music, the music, the music, the music, the music, the music, the music, the music, the music, the music, the music, the music, the music, the music, the music, the music, the music, the music, the music, the music, the music, the music, the music, the music, the music, the music, the music, the music, the music, the music, the music.In nominal terms, it was a little bit of a little bit of a shock, because they were a bit ahead of the stage at the time.I'm lucky, too. That's why.It was quickly noticed by a lot of former singers.I was invited to write songs for Tan, Zhang Kuo-young, Mei Yan-Fang and Zhang's students very soon.And then, uh, 10, 15, 20 years.I've written about two or three thousand lyrics in Hong Kong.And slowly moving from being a lyricist to being a er, uh, producer of a concert and planning to include songs, album producers, projects, and so on.Until 2005, there was a turning point or turning point in my career. What was it?At the time, the music in the interior began to fly.And then a lot of people invited me to Beijing and Shanghai to do some music cases.And then there was a bit of an imbalance in my heart.What's the imbalance?I was searching the 100-degree music list.The first 100 songs in Cantonese are probably only ten and eight, perhaps even fewer.And sometimes one month, two months, six months without my work.Ah, then I'll search the first 500 classics.With my work, it's probably some of the eighties and ninetys, uh, some of the classic Cantonese songs.That's when I thought, "Well, I'm not going to hit this market again."This is a market I'm not familiar with at all.I was 40, and it seemed too old to start over, too early to retire.So I didn't give up. I didn't give up.I then set up a workshop in Beijing by 0607.And fortunately, I've been involved in some big public service songs, including the Olympics of '08, the U.S. Expo of 2010 and some songs.And then, fortunately, in '08, I wrote a non-theme song for the film "The Heart."And it's a lot of, uh, attention to, uh, awards and so on.Uh, from '08 to the next 10 years of this year, I've done a lot of uh cases in my studio except for songs.Some even have nothing to do with music.Or even ads, spokespersons, or speaking er, acting er, acting concerts er, or filming MVs.Ah, there's a lot of cooperation with Disney.Ah, including the opening of their garden in, uh, 1 or 16 years, I co-authored a Shanghai theme song from the Uh Disneyland, in cooperation with Ms. Tan.Well, in all kinds of music projects, the only way I'm in love with a single act is actually a musical.In 1997, I was a writer for the music show "Lake of the Snow Wolf" by my friend Zhang, and probably a quarter of the lyrics, and I wrote a song.Then last year, 2017, was the twentieth anniversary of the Wolf Lake.And then I helped Mr. Ma Yong-seong, a very good cartoonist in Hong Kong, with the musical "The Clouds" for the opera's lyrics.I'm sure you've seen it in Windy Clouds.And then last year's production made me realize a lot of new technologies.On the stage, including water, fire, lots and lots of new projects, those new forms of production.At the end of this year, I'm supposed to be following up on my first personal musical, called Love in Starlight, developed in collaboration with the Hae Weng and Guang.In fact, "starlight" is a double-barrel meaning.It's a neighborhood that looks like a canteen.Then why am I the only one in all kinds of musical performances that I have a crush on?So the second part actually explains that.Cross-border art.From the moment I was born, I felt that I had the gift of seeing pictures, and seeing a story, and it was very easy for me to translate it into a very simple, uh, text.And then the year I was 10 years old.I could even turn that into a lyrics.Then I was in junior high.I often turn some English-English songs into Chinese songs and write a lot of different lyrics.And then, uh, when I graduated from high school, I went to college as a graphic design.So it's slowly turning into photography, even painting, and even then I like to do that model, which is a three-dimensional, uh, stereo thing.It's that I see a lot of different experiences in life, and I like to turn it into a work of creation.Uh, these are some of the pictures I used to take with pictures and films.Well, it's the luckiest thing I've ever done is work with an artist.Because every time I taped them, I filmed MVs and made ads.I actually came to the scene and I wanted to do something real, but I really liked it when I asked them to be my model and let me do it.Uh, it doesn't matter if they want it or not.So you should know how they feel when you look at their helpless eyes and their eyes.But that's what they respect me for, because they know I love it.And there's painting.Ah, sketch is the kind of uh, uh, performance I really like.Ah, I think this image of black and white gives me something that's very clean, emotionally stable and deposited.And then, uh, these things up here, they're one of the tasks I've always given myself.When I was on a plane, if it was a very short flight, in about two or three hours, I'd have to draw a picture.So when you see me, sometimes you look for magazines, airline magazines, and I do it all in two or two hours.But the one at the bottom left, the one at the bottom of the left, is a sketch.It's a fine sketch.These are sketches, and each one takes 100 hours.It could take two or three hours each day.Go home and paint for a few hours after work.Then it will take one month, two months, and some even six months to complete.So it's all texture, water, hair, one by one.I've been through this process and I've been able to talk to my heart, and I think I've had more time to go and think about all that.That's because art is connected. Art is connected.I've been asked by a lot of people. How does it work?I would then like to introduce the third part.That's what I used to do. I used to do it all the time.Ah, imbalance, asymmetrical, uh, contrast, and also elevate, that's some of the techniques I've often used.The first is simple.In fact, it's imbalance, asymmetry, imbalance from the picture, like the size of objects, before and after.Uh, the one in the upper right corner, for example.A cyclist faces thousands of people.The picture is asymmetrical and unbalanced.There's also the contrast, the contrast is the color contrast.It's like the top left corner.And then that right.The contrast between Leung Wing Chi's black and white and a red color.The sketch at the bottom left is also a color contrast.Ah, I'd like to mention that there's a slogan on the side of that soda can. I made it myself.Maybe you can't see it."love our Earth like it's your heart," is to love our planet like we love our own hearts.Look at the word "arth."If you move that last letter H to the front, it'll turn into heart.That's the line I came up with.And that's what I'm talking about.And then a lot of people say that art is a kind of elevate in life.And then what's uplifting?What I'd like to share is, if you see something that's very ordinary and feels very uncharacteristic, do you have the ability to see something different?Because I'm very fond of adapting a model.Change something quite normal and ordinary and turn it into something extraordinary, uh.For example, this camera stands up, and then I see that look, and I find it interesting, and I see that I can change it to something.Then I'll buy it back, open it, and then paint it, color it, turn it into a ship, and add some very militarized parts.And then it's also a map, and then it turns into something like a poster.Then the most important thing is the lower right corner, back to the point where it can still be photographed.It's also a normal stand-up.It's also a kind of life inspiration, and it's a kind of elevate.Uh, this is what I used to do with that draft.It's been a long time.Well, some parts are slowly being collected and some models are being collected, but there's no time to do them.I've been trying to turn a Mini's car into that helicopter.I have a friend, he's a parent, he's a parent.He asked me one day and said,Ah Shige, you've got so much interest, so much work.So how do you think it's gonna be possible to train his kids with a little bit of comparison, some focus, some interest?Then I asked him a question.I asked him, in addition to buying him the latest cell phone, the latest computer, and, uh, the notebooks, did you train some of his work, some things, some tasks, like a month, six months or more?He looked at me and said, no.Then I say, you hurry up and do it.New media, high technology, AI.If you want your kids to fight this age, you have to look different in it.Then you should give him some cell phones and notebooks and train him some of his works and tasks that take a long, long time to complete.Because there are fewer and fewer people who can do this.That's the first thing I told him about, the art of excellence.The second lift is.There is too much too much information now.Every day we look at the cell phone, we look at the micro-mails, we see the good things, we see the bad things, we get the things that we have, we get the things that we don't have, we get the things that we get, and it's easy to get them.So I gave him the idea of trying to get his judgmental skills up to the level of aesthetics.What is it?It's that we don't take time to criticize something bad or to scold someone we don't know.In turn, we will only spend time appreciating what we think is good, and spending time boasting about what we think is good.It'll make you, uh, the aesthetic standard. It's purer.The last part I want to share is hard work and slow life.There's a popular word called "slow work."Many think that slowness is a very loose life.Uh, sitting in a café for three hours is slow, not in my definition.It's really hard work to slow down.You just saw me do a lot of work, a lot of work.Allow me to be arrogant.It's me, too, and I'm, uh, even interested in something, and I'm a hard-working person.Because you don't just spend hundreds of hours drawing a couple of paintings and make models.It's not about making money.I'd like to share what's really the golden age in Hong Kong.In fact, average artists, usually creators, were also very diligent, including formerly Chang Kuo Ying and Mei Ying Fung.Uh, I won't say it today.Because they're stories you've probably heard.For example, Mae Fung used to be in the park.At the age of seven and eight, you have to practice and sing and dance every day.It's only then that it becomes the end of the world on the stage.This is my slow and slow life.That's what I'm trying to tell you in a way that I'm living, that's what I'm saying, that's unbalanced, that's asymmetric.Why?I've been listening to black glue records so far, it's very inefficient.Because mobile phones can find thousands of songs and tens of thousands of songs.But I'm still going to love listening to black glue. It's very inefficient.You have to flip that record every 15 minutes.Shoot, film, film pictures.Cycling retrofit.It's easy to drive all kinds of cars now, but I'm still like, uh, remodeled bikes.Every day we go to find parts around the world online.It's not expensive at all. It's just a matter of time.And this is through this process, and I'm slowly feeling a lot about everything I own.Ah, more and more of that stuff.Because now we're in the new media, and all the new times, everything is out of our minds.I'll get it soon. I'll forget it soon.So through this slow life, let me value more what I can get.Uh, I've been enjoying a model for a house lately.I'm building a train model at home.It's about getting a small city out of Japan.That's the kind of thing that takes time.You and you make a house, it takes, uh, a long time to finish one.So I'm on tape with a very new generation of artists who work with singers.I told them that diligence is a necessary attitude for you to survive in this circle.Except that wrapper, except for the man.Your attitude to life is a necessary condition to keep you young.For years now, popular art and popular culture have developed.It's really hard to make what we call creation from scratch, from scratch to nothing, to invent a new vehicle, to invent a new tune, or something.It's good to be able to do it.So, even if you're going to be young, you're going to have to work hard.And then as a summary for today.Uh, I'd like to tell you the story behind a song.This song is about the honor of Zhang.Because April is the season of the memory of Zhang Guofang.And then, in 1990, Zhang Guofeng decided to quit the altar.One night, we had dinner in Hong Kong in a central restaurant.And then he mentioned, uh, that there was an idea that he wanted to quit playing.And then I told him that your famous work was called "The Wind Continues" "The Wind Continues."And then I wanted not to write a song about the wind.Just let your fans make you think about you when the wind blows?It's called "The Wind Back."</seg>
<seg id=4>Arjun's imperfect, uh, maybe we all saw it.We met in 1984.I was a college student at that time, and I just graduated from the Academy of Fine Arts.Then he came to the youth palace to study drawings.It has been 34 years since 84 years.He called it a mild mental retardation, huh?So let's see, Penn, he's made more than 4,100 pieces, of which more than 2,000 are classical music.Then let's look at Chin now.So I guess 34 years ago, when such a special child came to our youth palace, I didn't even realize that, well, after 34 years, we would have a situation like that of an integrated education like special education.Well, maybe I'm the first teacher in the youth palace to face a special child.When he was born, his parents couldn't open his eyes, and he, uh, couldn't suck on milk and his body was soft.Then when faced with a child like this, they might really want to have some power to save them.Uh, one of the bottom, uh, one is me on the left, and the other one on the right is Penn.Uh, we can see a picture this big.A little body like him, waving brushes and painting.You can see that he's really a very gifted child.So, 20 years ago, when he published his first book, what about Peng, uh, we set up a class called Special Children's Art Experiment.And in this class, there's more than a dozen, and we're talking about kids with cerebral palsy, um, autism, Down syndrome, and so on.We're going to teach some of these kids free of charge, and Ping is in it.We're hoping to be able to, uh, have a case like Ping that inspires more special children to express themselves in art.So in 2006, when our second juvenile palace was inaugurated, we officially set up special education centres to provide specialized services for special children.In a year of 10 years, we had the support of lucky gold.Each year, the society is then offered 2,000 public-interest free degrees.Ah, so far we've got 15,000 free degrees.So we've got more than a dozen children, and now we've seen more than 2,000 of them, and we're really grateful.Well, because, uh, maybe it's because of Chin, we were just a small wish, and then we came to today, and we were very grateful.So we now have more than 60 courses in art education, and at the same time, we have the erm... to teach.For example, we have a hospital in Guangzhou City, we have some regular, some irregular, some in the cancer ward, uh, our art classes, some music classes.And then we'll be in the welfare home, and, uh, there's art classes, and so on.Our goal, then, is that every child will be able to make the best use of their own capacities.Every child is unique.Let them be the best of themselves.And then, in a year or four, we had another conglomerate.I'm going to show you a video of this conglomerate.It was our youth palace that walked for 20 years, and then the way of special education that we came to this moment, and we saw that we had a lot of ordinary children, with us and special children, and that we were in a very harmonious space of time like this.When I saw this picture, I really was, uh, very happy and very happy, because I really saw these kids, and they were living together.We can look.Uh, I've been sorting out some of the old TV shows on us in the past couple of days.And then I turned 30 years ago, in the art gallery of the Um Guangdong TV station, he was about ten years old at that time.And then he was really obsessed with painting.And, uh, he's still walking perfectly.And then it turned to a show like that in Eastern Time and Time, a central TV station almost 20 years ago.Then at that time, he had a more serious, uh, mental disorder.Ah, and then again, he was in the middle of his book.Uh, his mother was, uh, younger then, and then she used the sound of a squeezing to say her fears, her own fears, through tears.Twenty years have passed.My mom's pale now.The knee was operated on, and it was very difficult to act, and all kinds of diseases were entangled in the body.Oh, Peng's experience, the wind and rain in life.For example, because he pees, he can't pee, he uses a catheter.So every day, every time he comes out, it's really not easy.And then, uh, every year he goes to the hospital for a bladder surgeries.Well, life is like this up and down.He then drew, took medication and had a healing operation that became his norm.Then it was very difficult to travel because it was very difficult to hit a taxi.In fact, all children with limited mobility, especially those with cerebral cerebral problems, have an experience of having children growing up every day, their children growing up, their mothers and fathers becoming older, and they are increasingly unable to hold their children.And then, one day, they'll never be able to carry their children again.At the same time, this very common experience was that when they were struggling, they often couldn't even look at him.But I would like to say that what happened to them will certainly be ours.Why?Because everybody's going to be old, and everyone's going to be sitting on a wheelchair.Lately my parents, uh, one over 80, one over 90.They all went to the hospital.I watched them grow old, and my own body, ah, grew old.And then my legs and legs are sometimes uncomfortable, like knees that hurt, like these.Then I don't think I'm gonna be able to promise that I won't be in a wheelchair for the rest of my life.So, when I'm old, maybe one day I'll sit in a wheelchair like Penn, or I'll push that walker.So much, when we go back to 20 years of education and inclusive education for our special children.I'd really like to say to these special children and their families, and to their parents, thanks for having you.Because for 20 years, it seems that we have given you a lot, for example, that we have just been on the screen, and we have seen how many degrees we give them every week, and then how much resources we give them, and, um, how they speak in public, express their existence, demonstrate their talents, and so on.But what I want to say is that it is the children who give us the opportunity to regain the love we deserve, to love each other, and to learn to love each other.Because we seem to be helping them on the surface, and we are actually helping ourselves.Because each one of us can't guarantee that he will never sit on a wheelchair with a crutch.I did it because I wanted to be old one day, and when I was sitting in a wheelchair, I wanted to play a taxi, not because I was sitting in a wheelchair, and the taxi sighed, that's all.Today I turned out myself, and, uh, I wrote two words as the end of my statement today.This sugar baby I still don't know your name. It's good to have you.The day when the little one of you, the weak one, comes to me and hugs me and kisses me.This sudden sense of trust and love, like a warm sun, drove away all the shadows in my heart on that day.You were so strong at that moment that you could save the entire world that was lost by love.And the standards of this society, often look at you like this, you're just a flawed, even a loser.All the children of the Art Corps, it's good to have you.On that day I saw a little secretary of our art group pushing his little partner, a kid sitting in a wheelchair, passing by in a hurry from my car.The picture is so beautiful, it's firmly fixed in my heart.Today you have me and all of us here, perhaps only for the sake of her mother's concern for herself, her son's fear for her son and our fear that we might one day sit in a wheelchair.All similar concerns of everyone will be the past.Because when we have love like our own hearts.When we can be warm to each other, watch to one another and love each other, when we become a community of destiny, will such a time be far from us?Because in each other's love there will be no more fear and no more fear.I think that's the best thing about inclusive education.Thank you.</seg>
<seg id=5>Hello, everyone.I'm Oh Jung Dan, the founder of the ballet on the shoulder.Uh, because I've been an athlete since I was 6 and I was 16.Between the ages of 6 and 16, it was one of the happiest stages of my childhood.But that's for all the kids, but not for me.I'm 6 years old, and I've only done one of the most basic things, that is, I'm in pain every day.But these are all very good foundations for me.I'm in good shape, I'm in good ability, and I'm in good resilience.Only by doing this well will I be able to present myself as I am today.Later, for a variety of reasons, I was eliminated, and I was sent to the skill team, which is still a sports project.I've known my partner since I was six.Of course, at that time we didn't know that we were partners and that he was my husband.Well, it was a coincidence that the two of us, together with the teachers, became collaborators in two skill-mixed projects.I'm very afraid he'll bully me and even hit me.But the first time I saw him, I told him I said I could practice with you, but you had to promise me three conditions: first not to hit me, second not to yell at me, third not to fall on me.Why don't you say you can't fall on me?Because this project is high-altitude.It's up.It's possible for someone down there to fall on it if they're upset.He also acceded to my request and kept his promise.So we've been working together since 1992 until now, and he's been my partner.And my lifelong partner.In a game in '96, I fell over his shoulder, and I slipped, and then I jumped on the floor.I almost became Sanlan.But also because of this accident.I was fortunate enough to have been seen by the leadership of the Guangzhou Military Region Acquis.Then they invited us to Guangzhou, where I started a new path.I never thought I'd be an acrobat myself.So when I came to the warrior circus, I had no idea where I was headed.Because when I was playing abroad, we were just a two-man skill project.A reprogramming and then a performance abroad.There's a very well-known ballet master who is also the head of the Royal Danish Ballet, after reading our work.He said, "These two actors are so beautiful, they're like two ballet princes and princesses."Just because he said that.But I was wondering if I could try to wear a pair of toes.So I put these toes on, and I started my first step, standing on the ground and standing on my toes.But I'm just standing on the ground, I don't care.I'm not a professional ballet dancer.Because they've been since they were 10.I'm almost 20 by this time.So the ballet on the shoulder, from the beginning of this program, doesn't mean you know you're in this position from the very beginning.It's a step-by-step, I'm on my partner, I'm on my lover.Every inch of my skin has my footprints.Because he's lying on the ground and I'm stepping on it.Of course it's painful. It's a difficult process.When we were trying to get together, how did we get together?Only to be joined and to stand on the human body.But the place where we stand is something that we don't think about.We'll just have to try and find out where it's largest.And then our first position is to stand on the back of a man.What if the backside doesn't feel hard enough?Stand up on your shoulder.But where's the shoulder?Are you standing here or are you standing here?In the end, after hundreds of attempts, we felt that only this muscle was the largest area where bones could not be touched and where they could be.So we finally tried in this place.But in this position, you see this picture, one millimeter before and after, and I'm gonna fall.I do it every day in the midst of failure.Why is there a picture like this?This is my love's shoulder.Every day is blurred, because my two feet are on his body, and every day I have to turn around, turn around, and continue to rub in here.My toes, my shoes, they're covered in blood and puss.In a hot weather like this in Guangzhou, the practice is finished every day, and the next day a small thin layer is swollen and a stubby layer is swollen.The next day, I'll twist it down the first move.But we should do so no less than 100 times a day and hundreds of times a day.Why?In fact, I don't think it's much of a pain in the skin.Because of the bitterness of the flesh, we can all bear to be actors and athletes.Even if I break my feet, I'll be able to break it.But the worst is confusion and confusion.Why?Because we have no direction.No teacher can tell me this is right or wrong.I don't want to move. I don't have technical requirements.I do not know how these problems can be overcome.Because what is done today is not good, it is not good tomorrow, and it is not good for what is not.So every day is in this confusion.The two of us were in love, but we almost separated because of this.Because every day we struggle, we contradict, we quarrel and we complain about each other.We all want success, but we can't find a way.And what's confusing is what's going to happen when this work comes out.Because in the course of practice, everyone says, "Are you ready to trample on ballet? Are you ready to subvert ballet?"It's just that we don't know what we're going to do.It's really that feeling that I really feel the worst at that stage.Well, I think we're lucky we're stuck.No matter what difficulties we encounter, there are times when we stop, there are times when we want to give up, but in the end we stick to it.We also practiced standing on our heads back there.Because we go back to many countries to perform.I imagined that it would succeed, but I didn't really think that it would get so much recognition and certainty.As a Chinese actor, I think that in an environment like this, um, I can get the world, because it's true that people from all over the world are here to enjoy it, and I feel proud and proud to be an actor from China.I've been doing this since the second half of 1998 until I won this award in 2002.Four years, I can say a friend in Guangzhou didn't.I came here with my lover, from Northeast Liaoning, and, uh, spent 10 hours a day in rehearsal.It's hard to remember now, but I'm proud of myself, and I'm stuck.And God was very, very good to me, because not everyone worked so hard that they could make a difference, but I was recognized.And I did one very good thing.And it really is a full reflection of my terms, my values and my strengths.Now I've taken it as an interest in my life.A hobby, I'm enjoying it.I'm almost 40 now, but I'm still on the stage.Well, it's kind of tired sometimes, but it's kind of tired, and I think it's painful and happy, and enjoy it.I enjoy the work that brings me this fun, huh.Thank you!Well, then what we're going to say is that these are the feedback from some of the uh, audience in our show.We played at the Shanghai Grand Theatre, with 30 consecutive performances.Few plays in China can do this, and every audience can stand up and applaud.Really, I really feel very.Before each of my performances, I said that I was on the stage because I was tired, and I was really tired at dozens of consecutive shows, and sometimes I wanted the lights on the stage to stop.Can't we just go out of power today or have some kind of accident, and we can stop the show?There's this fantasy.But it's really time to start acting on the stage.It's still so invested and I'm going to finish my last show.At the end of an hour and 50 minutes, when I bowed to the audience, the audience stood up and applauded me, and I felt that everything was worth it.I feel too enjoying that moment.It's the tired stuff that's ahead and all that stuff is gone.So I think it was the happiest moment as an actor.So to date, I'm still obsessed with the stage, and my peak, probably until 2008.So this time, uh, it's an accident to fall from the top, and I'm pregnant.It should be a good thing.But for us, I'm on the stage, and at my peak, I'm not well prepared to think, and I have children.Then when I had the baby, my body was deformed.My kung fu is dead.I can't stand on stage like I used to.So this process of recovery is fresh to me, very painful and visible.Because on a 37-degree day in Guangzhou, I was wearing a fresh film in my weight-loss jacket and went for a run every day in Guangzhou for an hour and an afternoon.And then I eat on the scales every day.And then every meal I eat, no matter how many meals I eat on the table, I only have five bites, and I'll leave when I'm done.Because that's the only way I can lose my weight fast.I think the love I have for my own work is that at that time, it was a state of enthralling and obsessiveness.And why is it so urgent for me to recover?I found myself depressed.Because it really feels like you've done one thing, just on the stage, except what you did more than 20 years ago.I found out I couldn't do anything else.I can only represent my own values on the stage.So I very much hope that I'll be back on stage soon.My waist, my waist, my whole waist, I can't be as soft as I used to be.But there's one thing I'm glad to be out of the stage for so long.I find that sometimes life doesn't always have to be on the stage, and you get better and better.Stop this year, I think I've had a different harvest.My life, my stage experience.I feel different.When I was speaking to the audience, I felt that in my emotions, in my mind, it was another message.Everyone says Jung Dan, you're up again, you're up again.So I think it's a person who reaches a different stage of age, and the harvest is different, and the feeling is different.Because then I felt that there was a lot of this kind of power that didn't grow up, and I felt that it could not be felt until a certain age.Uh, that's one of my feelings.Then I went back to the stage, and I won this award in Russia.This award is a very rare thing for all dancers.And as an acrobat, I'm supposed to be a cross-border actor and I can uh, get this privilege.I'm proud of it, and I treasure it.So now I'm not just an actor, I'm more a carryr, a light passer.Because it is my duty and duty to carry on the ballet on my shoulder, a miracle that the Chinese have created, a technology, to pass on and develop.And I've raised a lot of kids.I hope that these children will live up to their dreams and that I can help them.And I also believe that dance children must be the strongest and the hardest to suffer.Then I'm sure they'll do anything in the future.Well, let's just say that the perfectness that can never be achieved, but the magic of ballet is every moment that always pursues perfection.Well, I'd like to say that for the first half of my life, thank you very much for meeting with the ballet on my shoulder.Well, standing on the stage, on my husband's shoulder, I feel very proud.I felt like I was invincible at that moment.Thank you!</seg>
<seg id=6>Good afternoon, everyone.I am Zhang Wu Hung from the Shanghai Microsystem of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.So I am reporting today on how we can contribute to the security of this project through this information technology, which is represented by the Internet of things.I want to look at it in a few ways.We all hate this tofu project, but tofu work is inevitable at this stage.We can recall that in 2007 the Qijiang Bridge collapsed in an instant as a result of the impact of the ship.This was also a very important event at the time.So the highway also has a lot of this tofu project.We can look at one of the ratings on the Internet, that's the natural highway, that's Gansu.Soon after the passage of vehicles in 2011, although its construction works at a cost of up to one billion kilometres.But within a few days of construction, the highway breaks open and is immediately out of use for a maintenance period.We can also see an incident in Shanghai.We had a similar incident on the side of the Lotus River.At that time, the building collapsed as a result of the crushing of one of the earth.And, of course, this building behind it is not very low for this, uh, second-hand room that it's made of.Because they found this glass in this building, it's still very good.It's just that it didn't have a good foundation, but that doesn't deny that it did have some kind of slippage at the time.As a matter of fact, it's a network of things.It can be built from the source of the building to its operation and up to its maintenance as a whole to provide some security for the building.So we can start by looking at what's called a network of things.The term " network of things ", which we gave Prime Minister Wen to Prime Minister Wen at the time of his visit to our laboratory's, uh, tinless subcentre, was in 2009.Prime Minister Wen then picked a network of things.Now we all know the word "netting ".So, while the word "netting" may be a little stranger to people's lives, we can see that there's actually a lot of things that are already online in life.We can look at some bikes like Moby, OFOs, and that's some of the good applications of the Internet.It's the smart driving or the car that's in there now.This network of hundreds of these different sensors is inside each vehicle to monitor the quality of the vehicle and its operational status.So here's what Shanghai's doing right now.Put the poles in a system like that.We can make it a recharge stake down there, then we can make a WIFI, and then we can do some of this environmental monitoring on its basis.It's also a good application for the uh-material network.So we can look back at some of the earlier applications of the Internet, and I'll start from the right.This is the blue algal monitoring that we did in Lake Tai in 2009, when the water quality of the Lake Tai basin was also very poor.And what about the security system in Shibo, which was also a big, monolithic network system at the time.We can look to the left.And this is the network system we made for this thing at Pudong Airport.From 2006 to more than a decade now, he has been working normally.And we've got a dozen people inside who want to destroy, but he hasn't.The main reason is that we have such a networked system to carry out some early monitoring of it and to be able to pre-empt and capture these spoilers.So going back to today's theme is how we're going to help build this safe on the E.U.T. Network?It's a safe place for us to look first at the construction of the building.What can the Internet do?We have a few important things in the construction.First, how can a builder ensure that the right person is a qualified person doing something that he can reasonably do?On the other hand, we would like to ensure that this material, including its processes, including its safeguards, is met.Let's take a look at the first of these. There's some of these things in the building site, and we can monitor in real time whether the manager is on duty.He has, electrician.Is he really an electrician operating some electrical devices?Is there a corresponding certificate for the man who hangs this tower?There are some systems that can take root, some techniques that can be used to locate.So electricity is not qualified for building materials.We can also enter from every material in the early stages, and I will monitor it and place it in the designated position when it is tested.When people move these building materials again, the system is able to remain a retroactive step from the time it enters and exits to the time it is acquired.It's like we're making food retrospectives.And the third thing is that we need to make sure that the process is not perfect.We'll have, uh, some of the means of networking, sensors, including some of our video surveillance, to detect whether or not we're meeting the standards.Also, we can see if the safeguards are in place and our scaffolds are stable and reliable.So we'll do some sensors up there to monitor this mass.So on this basis, uh, we did a whole set of things-based solutions or systems.We can see a variety of these sensors at the bottom.We can manage the personnel, the tower and the hook, including the elevator.We also manage the environment, including drainage, including videos, and the movement and exit of vehicles, including their weight, and some automatic detection.With these sensors, we control all the condition of this entire construction site by means of information.After taking control, we built up a variety of systems for this type of application to monitor and analyse it safely.So let me give you a few examples.First on the left, when we have these security incidents, I want to make sure where my people are, where my equipment is and where my rescue measures are.In this case, there is also a system for monitoring.The tower's safe is also, uh, a very important system.We'll have sensors on this tower to detect whether it's tilted, whether it's swinging and so on.What about environmental construction and monitoring, which is now a very demanding piece of government.We can make sure that the water in the atmosphere is not contaminated, so this is a very important piece of the network that solves this construction safety.And this is a big question that we're thinking about.Our country has been building this glass curtain wall since the 1980s.The high buildings in our city are also very dense.Our entire glass curtain wall is 85 per cent global, a very high amount.But there's a problem with the glass curtain wall.Although the glass curtain wall has many advantages, it's more beautiful, and then it's relatively simple to build.So the glass actually lasts only 15 years.In normal use, the glass's structural glue, it's only been on it for about 10 years.So whether the glass is broken or the structural glue is not working, it's going to have a lot to do with it.What about the glass wall monitoring this area?Unfortunately, since China was the country that used the largest glass curtain wall in the world, its research in that area was not as advanced as it was abroad.So now the conventional tests are probably the most we can do with a piece of glass behind our backs.So there's also some kind of test to hit with this rubber hammer, and look at the sound of this glass, so the comparison is primitive and backward.At the same time, we have some building materials whose lifetime is mostly glass.It includes structural glue, including some of the structural parts in it, and has a relatively short life, unlike our concrete structure.And the third is the fact that the external factor also has a greater impact.Typhoons have a significant impact on bridges, but typhoons also have a similar effect on glass.It goes on and on and on and on, right?At the same time, our glass is washed every year.Then when the outside walls are rubbing, this tower hangs down.And then when the wind blows, it swings, and it hits the glass, so it brings a lot of safety.Well, we actually had a similar incident in Shanghai in the early years.The whole glass fell down.Good thing it hit the car, didn't hit anybody.Think of an egg that falls off dozens of floors that can smash a dead man, not to mention a glass.So we're using the technology and means of networking to work out a system for the security monitoring of this glass wall. It's some kind of collaboration with some schools.So we have this sensor at the front end, which is capable of detecting this vibration, stress, reaction, temperature, etc., some of the parameters that affect the safety of the glass.So there are also some transmission techniques in this narrowband network that can very easily capture some state data from the front end glass.So when we collect it, we can use some big data, some hand tools for cloud computing in this platform.It also combines artificial intelligence, which is now more fashionable.We have done a great deal of this data collection and analysis.Then you can warn early about a model that will break the curtain wall that built this glass.In that case, we can see the extent of the risk.The second question is, do we have access to the glass wall or not?In fact, in accordance with our safety standards, glass is relatively safe, but with our system, we believe that the future will be safer.So the third question is, how we solve things on the Internet is some kind of safety in the process.This map on the left is our gold-trading building.When we think about the security of this building, we probably think about the high-rise building first.In fact, some of the places that are now very dangerous are these micro-sites, including this type of rental housing.There are also more people living in some of the family's workshops, including water, electricity and fire hazards.Like we're in this theater right now, if there's a fire next to it, it's probably gone, but we don't know if there's a fire next door.By the time it burns, we might be very late.Are there any means and measures to solve this problem or to provide us with some clues?Yes.So we're, uh, working on a lot of methods, and we're doing a lot of networked systems for a lot of different applications.So this is also the kind of smoke that's hot now called the stand-alone smoke.The traditional smoke is probably linked to the fire department, including the spray facility.In any given building, it must have this equipment if it is to be certified.But now there's some independent smoke, so what we can integrate into it is some of the more hot technologies called NB-IOT, including Lora and so on.Because of these narrowband transmission techniques, for example, it can last for more than 10 years, we can put this on the head of the room and incorporate some of this voice broadcast information on it.So if there's a fire next door, we all know it in this room.So this is with the support of the Shanghai Economic Commission and the CST.We've got this Orient bead from this Yang Po and the Rainbow Pass, and now we've got, uh, nearly 30,000 of this independent smoke.So you can buy this equipment and put it in your house if you're interested in it.You can see through APP that there's not this kind of fire or danger in your house.So the safety of the elevator is a big problem now.Shanghai is actually a place where, uh, an elevator is very widely used.We have nearly 300,000 elevators in stock, and there may be thousands of elevators over 15 years of service.So there are 780,000 in 10 to 15 years, so that's a big amount.The actual useful life of the elevator is generally only 10 years, as required, so it is a big question how to maintain it.Although we didn't have that many accidents, there's certainly a lot of work to be done for the safety of this elevator.So now we're talking about adding a lot of sensors to the elevator, including the floor, including the floor, including the smoke, including the current of this, uh, major wire that I can calibrate the elevator, and so on, including its temperature, to determine whether the elevator is safe.So, when we do this, we get a lot of status data from the elevators, so we can do a lot of intelligence analysis remotely.I can actually do one thing when I'm done with the analysis, and it's this rationalization of the elevator.The normal security of the elevators now may be carried out by people on paper.Did he go?How's Viva?No one knows.But with the future of a networked system, we can effectively guarantee the safety of each elevator.So this isn't really my specialty.It is in this building that we will have some new winds, including some water supplies, some drainage systems.So some of them have some technical means of networking.We can look at the wind, for example, at the vent of the new wind, and look at the quality of the air in this inner room, what its temperature is, what its humidity is, and then adjust the most appropriate temperature and humidity.So in the drain, we can look at the amount of water, the speed at which it's going, and then there's some contamination in it, and so on.That would make the building safe.That's what our partner did on that little Guangzhou loin.High buildings like this, we've got some uh sensors on it, and we can look at some of the swings of this tower, see some of its vibrations, and we can tell if it's in a safe state.So this is what I think this kind of thing will be used later on high buildings like ours, including the Shanghai Center.And the other one, this one was a job for me in '78.That's when we made this security system for the South Water North Central.The median line then draws 1432 km of water from the Dan mouth reservoir, which is the southern border of the Lake North River, to Beijing and Tianjin, where 1 billion cubic metres of water per year.But there are a lot of problems in this.And we can look at it, and we can look at it, and we can look at it, and we can see it, and we can see it, and we can see it, and we can see it, and we can see it, and we can see it, and we can see it, and we can see it, and we can see it, and we can see it, and we can see it, and we can see it, and we can see it, and we can see it, and we can see it, and we can see it, and we can see it, and we can see it, and we can see it.So it's very complex.There are, then, a lot of security problems.A sink like that, two clicks long, it's full of water.The pressure of thousands of tons of water on the entire base is also very high.So we've got a variety of sensors up there to monitor its deposition, seepage pressure, so we've built up some systems for this, uh, engineering security monitoring accordingly.At the same time, we combine some of the weather information on the periphery with, uh, some of the weather department and some of the rainfall stations on the ground.And at the same time, we did some monitoring of water quantity and quality and so on.Bring this information together to protect the safety of this entire operation in the north of the south.And at the same time, we built this system to prevent human intrusion.That means if someone climbs my fence into my channel, I'll know that I can still easily get him to, uh, find him in advance and point him out.That would also enhance the safety of the project.Let me give you an example.This kind of invasion is also a great danger.Because this is an artificially dug project, it's hard to get out of this channel once we're in it.Because this is the edge of cement, it's very difficult to climb up.So human security is also a very central issue in the whole South Water North.So let's talk about some of the technical means of connecting the various things before us to solve this or to ensure the security of this building.Whether it's the bridge, whether it's the building, the highway, or the North of the South.The new sensor of the future is indeed a very core piece of it, and perhaps the future is something that can be done.But what we're talking about here is the intelligent architecture of the future, which necessarily informs the construction of the building, including its running, updating and maintenance to the future.So, on the one hand, raising the security level of the building and, on the other hand, making it easier for people to live.But I can see that our country actually has a lot of flaws in this, uh, new sensor.On the one hand, we are very much in need of new types of sensors, but we can also see them in particular with regard to these high-end intelligent sensors.The United States, Japan and Germany are relatively advanced, accounting for about 70 per cent of the world, and our countries are about 10 per cent.At the same time, from the point of view of production, there are only about 20,000 sensors in our country.So this is, uh, one of our big shorts, so what's the good thing about the other one?It's our national, uh, sensor industry.The original imitation has now begun gradually to expand to higher ends.Uh, some chip factories in our country are starting to take some high-end routes.Let me give you a few simple examples.Some of our high-speed accelerators, including gyroscopes, were used relatively well in this military industry and are now being converted to civilian use.And then some of our pressure sensors are now also being applied in this water table, in the gas table.Including some of the blast-proof sensors we made, we were already using this security check, including at Pudong Airport.We have some equipment for this millimetre wave, including some for security checks, which is already in use at the airport.So I believe that in the next three to five years, we have many high-end sensors that can make a breakthrough.So with these sensors, we can provide the building, especially the future building, with more powerful technologies and tools for its safety, and for its safety to be protected.Thank you!</seg>
<seg id=7>Hello, everyone.I am a forest. I am both an observer of the second meta-culture and a participant in the second meta-culture.I am sure that everyone here has heard, or has heard, more or less of the concept of binary dollars.But perhaps everyone does not necessarily know where the second dollar came from or why it was popular.If we go back to the source of the term binary, we'll find that word, actually from Japan.And in Japanese, it was actually a geometry term, meaning two-dimensional space, two-dimensional world.And today, we have a special discussion of the second dimension of the word Internet popular, which in fact did not acquire its semantics and its usage until the mid-1990s.In my view, we can trace the “source of all evils” to an animated film called the Mobile Warship Touch, which was first aired in 1996.It's a science fiction animated film that sets the story background at the end of the 22nd century.In this animated film, there's a particularly interesting group of characters.Well, they were a long time ago, and, uh, a long time ago, when they were talking about the twenty-first century, and they were descended from a group of human immigrants who were banished to Jupiter by the civilization of the Earth in the twenty-first century.And when their fathers were banished to Jupiter, they carried with them an animated film called "The Stifler 3".For a long time, this Stirler 3 became a particularly special presence in Jupiter civilization.Because, uh, the Jupiterians, not only were passionately worshipping Iron Man 3 and using the spirit of the Steel Man 3 as their own tenets of life, but they were also deeply obsessed with the female actor of the animated film, Vegetables.Think of the vegetables as the goddess of your dreams.Yet, these Jupiterians, who yearn to have contact with the vegetables, will never be able to fulfil their wishes. Why?Because it's like us outside the screen and the Jupiters on the screen, after all, in a world that's between them.In the episode, Jupiter, an animated audience, and the cuisine of the play, an animated character, were also in a world of sharp isolation.Well, you can feel that it's an insurmountable physical and physiological constraint.In the face of such a constraint, the people of Jupiter, who are trapped in hopelessness, can only persuade one another."It's fine, but she's a second-dollar girl!"I don't know if that line has inspired any deep resonance.Anyway, when I first saw that line, it was deeply resonant with me.And when it was aired in Japan, it inspired many Japanese enthusiasts known as the Mansions, who echoed them.Well, let's just think, we've all loved a lot about animations, cartoons, games.But we have absolutely no possibility of physical, or biological, contact with these roles that we love.Because of those roles, those that we love, after all, exist only in a virtual world made up of two-dimensional lines, graphics and dynamic images.Because this line is so forthright, and, among other things, the concept of binary dollars, in particular, highlights precisely and succinctly the difference in the dimension that separates us from their region and the media quality that makes them so special.So, after the mid-1990s, more and more mobile game fans used the concept of binary dollars to refer to the two-dimensional virtual world created by animations, comics, games and the media.But what is particularly important here is that we look at this Jupiterian, who, when he uses the concept of binoculars, when he uses the concept of binoculars, often seem to separate the binoculars from the trio.That is to separate the two-dimensional virtual world from the three-dimensional real world zone in which we, the real people, live.At first glance, it seems to constitute a confrontation between a seemingly real and a false one.But if you're going to learn the potential of Jupiter's words.In fact, he expressed his true and strong love for the Second World and the Second dollar role.It is this love that makes them eager to have real contact with the vegetables.It is this love that makes them devoutly adopt the spirit of steel as their own tenets of life.And according to one of my observations and experiences of the second meta-culture.We can also note that, in the sense of psychological truth, rather than physical truth, many vagabonds often get quite a genuine emotional experience from the secondary dimension of the world.Even as opposed to a three-dimensional society that needs to be confronted with some kind of masked face.Their emotional commitment to the binary world may be more sincere and intense.Thus, the relationship between the real and the false, the real and the false does not seem to be simple to judge and distinguish with a dichotomy of thinking.Perhaps it is precisely the question that deserves to be asked.Why do so many people have such a genuine and intense emotional commitment to those who are often called virtual worlds, virtual players?Here, I'm going to introduce an academic, theoretical term to help me interpret and interpret this socio-cultural trend.When I went to undergraduates, I had an experienced, uh, senior who taught me that, he said, postmodernity is a basket and everything can be done in the past.Well, I'm here to share with you a theoretical concept — a post-modern concept — that is, a very diverse one.Different people will use it in different ways, and different commentators will fill it with different theoretical content.And here I am, when I share with you the concept of post-modernity, how do I use it in a specific sense?I'm learning from a Japanese cultural research expert called Euh Dong-hoki, the fat mansion on the right behind me, uh, his usage.Or is it based on the French post-modernist philosopher Leotta, quoted by Dong Hoki.According to them, post-modern conditions mean, first and foremost, the decline of grand narratives.What's the grand narrative?The grand narrative here is that, since the Enlightenment, the modern political community has relied on a set of conceptual systems that bring its members together.They provide authoritative interpretations of the rules governing the functioning of society.They give value and meaning to the transcendent nature of human practice, and they give a coherent account of the development process of history.But in the 20th century history has changed dramatically.Some grand narratives that are supportive of modern civilization have gradually lost their persuasiveness and appeal.From the outbreak of the First World War to the end of the cold war, one tragic and traumatic historical event almost destroyed the edifice of humanism, enlightened reason and historical progressive theory in these extreme years.The transformation of liberal capitalism and modern technology, while making society as a whole mobile and highly fragmented, has largely dissipated certain grand narratives of their social roots.As the grand narrative of modernity collapses in the post-modern state, it is a new generation that grows up in the ruins of grand narratives.We are ushering in a vacuum of cultural values.Like the Jupiters of the Mobile Warships, they were banished to Jupiter and cut off their spiritual ties with the civilization of the Earth.In the post-modern situation, we, the new generation that has been and has grown up, also have difficulty in getting our spiritual world together with the grand narratives that modern civilization once tried to construct.It is in these times that the culture of the second dollar has played a very important role and has had a very important spiritual effect on us.In the second dimension of culture, like The Steel Man 3, which fills the spiritual, cultural and value vacuums of the Jupiterians, there are a lot of excellent secondary works that often provide an ambitious worldview setting system while telling an interesting story.These worldview systems provide alternative macro narratives to those who are in the ruins of grand narratives, which we can also call binary macro narratives.And, of course, the secondaryists are diverse and diverse, uh, but as far as my personal acceptance experience is concerned.Where the second dollar is most attractive to me, it is precisely one of the spiritual effects of the two won's grand narratives.Since I was a kid, I've been renting this Seven Dragonball or The White Book from a comic book shop on the street at a price of five cents.When I was a teenager, I was on a television set, I was on a desktop and I was watching "The ninja of Fire" and "Digital Baby."When I was a young man, I had access to "Fate" by tablet computers, by laptops, by smartphones.These two-dimensional works, which I deeply love and which I am deeply obsessed with, tend to break the line between so-called traditions and modernity, the East and the West, secularism and mysticism, technology and magic.The heterogeneity of elements has shaped an ambitious world-view setting system.In the interest of such a binary view of the world, technology is no longer boring and cold, but as if it were animated and magical.At the same time, magic does not constitute a call to the ex-modern ghost, but rather a source of wonders for glamour through the new media.Such a vision of the world would allow those of us who may identify with, and take on, character roles and possess extraordinary abilities.And in a vast and interesting time and space, there are wonderful experiences.And these wonderful encounters, in turn, are passive, new media like games that give a visual effect to bragging.So, they form a pleasure reactor, like a powerful power-eating reactor that provides a source of joy for the readers of comics, animated viewers, game players.More importantly, for me, the surprises that take place in the context of these binary world views are often given some great significance in the development of storylines that relate to the destinies of communities and even the destinies of the world.At the same time, the role of the person is placed in a relatively extreme situation, thus stimulating the emotional energy inherent in the bond between the role of the person.What I am talking about here is a binary term, which refers to a strong and profound emotional connection between human beings.For me, there is a narrative that is often seen and tested.As the world's huge crises continue to deepen, the interlinkage between the role of the individual is constantly threatened and tested by close to life and death.In order to maintain this fragile but guarded bond in extreme circumstances, we will agree and take on a secondary role.The bond of origin must be turned into a key to the potential to release the energy inherent in the small inner universe and to try to save the outer universe while protecting it.Why does such a narrative strike me repeatedly?In my view, it is because if the audio-visual medium succeeds in creating a good sense of introspection and if the animated viewer, the reader of the cartoon and the player of the game are able to come into it in good faith, then the emotional strength that such a bond may achieve will be extremely difficult for us, secondary fans in the post-modern situation, to experience in the usual, mechanical repetition of three meta-lifes.Further, the world viewing and scenario design of such a secondary work would also allow many of the transcendent values that have been lost to me for a long time to be self-explanatory, at least for the time being, within the narrative framework and emotional structure of the work.When I see Sun Wukong, Hm-Hum-Huh-Huh, based on the principle that “the play is not nonsense, the adaptation is not a fabrication”, I'll call him Carcarot here.When I saw Carcarot, he was constantly transcending his limits in order to protect his important partner and the planet.When I see a vortex of vortex, in order to achieve a world of mutual understanding between one person and another, I am constantly subjected to tribulations and tests that are hard to imagine.When I saw Knight Saber, at the cost of his own demise, and at the cost of the love of his life, I waved the sword of victory and destroyed the evil Grail.When I see deer eyes, she sacrifices her life and all traces of her existence to reverse the causes and consequences of the entire universe, bringing the ultimate hope to every magical girl who is dying of despair.The resulting feeling of blood and highness is almost impossible for me to experience in the three meta-social environments in which nihilism, cynicism, connoisseurism and extreme individualism pervade.It is in this sense that the grand narrative of the binary has, for me, probably served as a spiritual proxy for many of the secondaryists.We often hear such harsh criticisms from the elders of the second dollar.For example, you're running away from reality.For example, you're drowning in virtual.But it seems to me, from another angle, that we look at and understand the words.The grand narrative of modernity no longer has the meaning and value of truth for us.If we had been inexorably in the midst of a real ruin.Can we, then, also interpret the hobby of the binary as a spiritual quest for indemnity?Or is it understood as a immersion experience of a super real world that is more real than real?Well, I just said that, especially when I gave those four examples, there might be a lot of friends here who would think, "Oh, he's a good man."Cough, uh, as a man who's been through a lot of battles, see a lot of second-dollar lovers.When I face three won friends, I am often identified, recognized or mocked as a second-degree patient.Well, you can be sure that patients like me who are second and second-degree patients, who are, uh, very diverse in form and form, are just one of those types, and perhaps even one of the old Fashioned types, huh?But what I'm going to say next is likely to make a lot more disconcerting for the three-timers.Because we can observe that, since the 1990s, it was not only post-cold-war cynicism that prevailed across the globe.Moreover, in the specific social context of Japanese society, the people of Japan have suffered the collapse of a bubble economy that has ushered in a long period of economic stagnation, which has been called the “punishment of the Great Depression”.The young people who grew up in this period of great depression, faced with the realities of stratification and with the fate of the difficult interaction between self-fought and the formation of history, inevitably fall into a heavy sense of disillusionment and a strong sense of incompetence.At the same time, these young people, like Shinjinji, the protagonist of The Gospel of the New Century, live in a consumer society of post-industrialism.They have access to highly developed cultural creative industries at all times and at all times, quantifying for them and generating a rich variety of cultural consumer goods in a crowd-based manner, as well as obtaining pleasure and comfort from them.Against the background of such an era, a group of, uh, royal family members, known or derided as “false houses”, emerged.Or, in the words of Dong-hoki, this is a generation that has emerged in a more complete post-modern situation without any need for grand narratives.So, the question is, who's good at digging?11th district NERV Quangen Hall!Eva excavator, you deserve to have it.I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sick again. I'm sick again. This was a trance.It's not my question.The question I have to ask is, what is the driving force that drives these royals to spend the second dollar if they do not need even the grand narrative of the second dollar?According to Dong Hoki, it is neither the story of the surface nor the vision of the world that really drives their cultural consumption.It's a secondary role that shows up in the story and can be pulled out of the situation.And to enable these actors to replicate continuously the re-production of a database of the budding elements.Before explaining this new concept of the Neo-Elemental Database, we need to recall a very important industry model for the secondary meta-industry.Well, you've already heard of IP operations, or, in Japan, it's often called MediaMix.For example, after Hit the Giants became a high-profile comic book.Rapidly, there was an animated and adapted game of The Hulk, as well as a range of peripheral derivatives.For example, after Gospel Warriors of the New Century became an apocalyptic animator.An adapted comic and adaptation game for Gospel Warriors of the New Century, as well as a range of peripheral derivatives, soon became available.For example, in The Gate of Destiny.After becoming a high-human game, it quickly became available with the adaptation of animation, the adaptation of comics and a range of peripheral derivatives.It is not just secondary cultural industries that produce cultural products from multiple vectors and develop product groups across multiple vectors.Moreover, secondary fans use existing products as a repository of material for use by me, producing content generated by users of a variety of vector vehicles.For example, homogenous people, homogenous drawings, homogenous videos, homogenous dramas, homogenous games, cosplay, homogenous neighborhoods, handicrafts, etc.And that's the problem, and we can imagine that, in this IP operation, in the same people's derivatives, storylines are really changing.Even worldviews are not solid, but can be derived or handed over to various parallel universes.What kind of drags binary users to the sea of content made up of IP product chains and fans' culture?In the present situation, the most likely answer is not the grand narrative of the second dollar that patients like me would be keen on.It's the role of the binoculars that attract the Jupiters like vegetables.I would like to stress here, in particular, that these binary roles can exist on their own, beyond what is happening and out of the worldview.So it's like "The Future of First Voice" or a popular product like Love Live.The role-setting of a virtual icon with one or a group of binary characters is sufficient to support a product chain that cuts across multiple vectors.What is it that allows these players to maintain a minimal degree of relative consistency for those secondary users who love them when they travel through products of different vector carriers, when they travel through parallel universes of different world views?It is a particular combination of labeled, non-narrative human elements in a given role.Or, in the words of Dong-ho-chul, the budding element, a series of budding elements in particular combinations of particular characters.In this case, the original element is the element of the person who enables the binary role to awaken the love of the binary user.In the logic of a highly mature cultural industry.Those who win the secondary role favoured by a range of users will have their personal set-up elements disassembly into a database of embryonic elements that can be replicated for cultural industries.In the secondary sector, both practitioners and producers of content generated by users can take their own needs from this large, embryonic database.Through the disassembly of the budding elements, through the reorganization of the budding elements, through the recycling of the budding elements and through the creation of a variety of budding roles.Well, I say this as if it were very abstract, so let us give an example, for example.I've got three, uh, pretty popular second-rate characters behind me.So on my right, on your left, tomorrow's scent, she's one of the leading actresses of the 1995 landmark animation, The Gospel Warriors of the New Century.So she's also a ponytail lady, a labeled character with such a cute combination of elements.And soon after being set up by Miss Ponytail, who has been shown by the market response to be a popular and cute combination of elements, the second dollar industry was widely adopted.However, it is noted that adoption does not amount to repetition.It's about creating a new budding role in the reorganization process.For example, one of the leading actresses of the "Fate" series that appeared in the middle, uh, and on the right of everyone, the key player in the "Door of Destiny" was Phillis.They all have such attributes as pride, double ponytails, ladies.But she has a new set of novel elements that are new, and there is a subtle difference between this tomorrow's fragrance, and new combinations have taken place, which has led to a number of new budding roles.Or we can look again at Sun Sang-heung in The King's Glory.As a matter of fact, she has nothing to do with the princess of history.But as a person from the name of Princess Wu, she was also given a pair of ponytails, ladies, such a cute combination of elements, such a person.At the same time, the designers of the game, referring to the stories of history and popular culture, gave Sun Sang-hsiang the idea of using bows and arrows.So if she shows up in "Fate," she's definitely Archer.So, by reference, for Sun Sang-hsiang, a pair of ponytails and ladies, and for adding, collating and combining hand-held long-range artillery, this is a weapon-like attribute.As you can see, it is precisely in a binary set that has to break the boundaries of history and science fiction that it has been possible to create a budding combination of elements.Then we'll find out that, although many of the royal family who are in love with each other, they all emphasize that the dual role that I love, and that I love, is unique.But in the logic of the cultural industry, those, uh, are identified as image symbols of the same role, whether in animation, comics, video games, or in the surroundings, hand-made, Cosplay.It's actually a specific combination of some of the budding elements drawn from the database.And it's these budding combinations of elements that are implemented and presented in every specific worldview set-up, in the context of present events, and in the vectors.So why does such a binary role, which is a combination of cute elements, have a continuing appeal to the royal family?One possible interpretation, but I cannot agree without reservation, is this.Each of us lives in a stranger society shaped by highly mobile marketed employment and large-scale urbanization.Such a society makes it easy for each and every one of us to fall into a sense of isolation and alienation from atomization.And the decline of the grand narrative that we have just mentioned makes it difficult to establish a universal and shared social ethic.Such an atomic survival dilemma is further exacerbated.For these post-modern subjects, whether they are uh-others in human relationships or larger players as social rule systems.In fact, it is very difficult to act as a basis for determining the answer to the mystery of our desires, but rather constitutes a troubling problem after another.In a situation like this, in a bipolar world.The dichotomy, which is spread all over the room with labeled secondary roles, provides another easy way for a digitally viable mansion to be satisfied without the need for intermediaries from others.The embryonic elements that induce demand and are highly tailored to meet it can create a set of closed and fast loops between deficiency and satisfaction for binary users.And that's why, these budding elements, the specific combination of these budding elements.The CP mix between these budding elements and the budding elements can effectively serve as searchable keywords.The binary user is drawn from the ocean of that big data to the content resources that fit its needs through a variety of search engines.And that is why they can effectively act as a clear and recognizable desire to drive these binary lovers to gain a relatively stable source of pleasure in changing worldviews, in keeping with their particular interests, from changing story situations.Such a pandemic both points to a socio-cultural trend that deserves attention and raises very important issues that deserve further discussion.The charismatic illusion of the second dollar provides alternative satisfaction for post-modern subjects'meaning demands and emotional needs.Is macro narrative no longer necessary for the functioning of human communities?Is it no longer necessary for the establishment of intimacy when new media interfaces in the post-industrial consumer society are filled with fascinating roles that are shaped by the combination of human elements and digital images?Further, with more and more IP-operated projects, and with more and more MediaMix initiatives, attempts have been made to establish such a whole-of-the-industry chain as a way of entangled play and video industry.As more and more popular products become available, they synthesize video material from the scenery with a computer, so that some digital animations are combined.To create the fascinating illusions that have enthralled us.As more and more new technologies, such as virtual reality technologies and enhanced reality technologies, have become commercialized on a large scale.The boundaries between virtual and real, and indeed between them, are becoming increasingly blurred and ambiguous.What we can also ask is whether the concepts of binary and triple dollars, which are based on differences and are based on antagonisms, will also become obsolete.I can't give a clear answer to these interesting questions.I am here, in fact, just trying to play a role that will inspire more creative and insightful thinking and discussion.This is where I will share today, and thank you very much for your patience.Thank you!</seg>
<seg id=8>Hello!Welcome to our UNIT dialogue system advanced course.I'm a research and development engineer from the 100-degree UNIT platform.This session will introduce DM Kit, the open-source dialogue management framework of UNIT.Let us first look at the overall structure of the system of dialogue.In general, we can break down the mission-based dialogue system into three modules: dialogue understanding, dialogue management, resource retrieval and task implementation.As an example, users of the reservation hotel's dialogue system have entered the phrase “Help me to book today's plaque in Beijing, like the one at the house of the land store”.The dialogue understanding module has received such a natural language input and processing, the corresponding intent and the vocabulary of the sentence.The intention here is to book a hotel, and the word slot includes a hotel, a room type and time.This intent and vocabulary will be used as input for our follow-up dialogue management module.The dialogue management module will be implemented by selecting the corresponding actions in the context of the current state of dialogue, based on the intended input and the word chute.For example, hotel reservations can now be initiated based on the intention of the hotel booking and the hotel, room type, time slot dialogue management module.This leads to the selection of hotel booking actions and guides follow-on resource retrieval to the operation of the task execution module.External hotel booking services are called, hotel bookings are completed and the booking results are fed back to users in natural languages.We have thus completed a round of interactive dialogue.Well, what kind of framework does such a dialogue system structure correspond to UNIT?Similar to the previous decomposition of the dialogue system, we can simply dismantle the UNIT system framework into two parts.One is the cloudy dialogue understanding service.It is responsible for the input of natural languages into the phrasing of the intent of the dialogue and the verbs.Another component is the dialogue management and resource retrieval and task implementation modules.This part of UNIT provides two ways for developers to choose to achieve it.The first option is for developers to achieve simple dialogue responses through the configuration of voice-change responses on cloud platforms.The second option is the DM Kit offline dialogue management framework that we will focus on in this lesson.Through the use of DM Kit, developers can achieve more complex dialogue process management and task implementation.This will be followed by a presentation on the design and use of DM Kit.First, let's look at the dialogue in DM Kit in the abstract.In DM Kit, there are two main concepts to the dialogue, namely, the status of the dialogue and policy.The status of the dialogue indicates the status of the current user-system dialogue.And policy can be understood to deal with the logic module for the most basic dialogue.For each round of requests for dialogue, DM Kit receives the user's input into the natural language, visits the cloud dialogue understanding service, and interprets the natural language as the intent of the dialogue and the vocabulary.On the basis of the intent obtained, combined with the vocabulary, with the current state of dialogue, DM Kit may choose the corresponding policy for implementation.If we assume, for example, that we have chosen Policy A here, DM Kit will implement the logic of dialogue described by Policy A.External services or a knowledge base may be accessed during the processing process to obtain data and to generate a voice or command as the ultimate skill response to the system.At the same time, with the completion of the implementation of the policy A, DM Kit will update the current state of dialogue to the state of dialogue designated by the policy A, such as the dialogue status 2 here, in order to achieve a jump-over update of the state of dialogue.And here's what we're going to say about the concept of policy in DM Kit.Polity is the most basic module in DM Kit dealing with the logic of dialogue.It defines the complete behaviour of skills in a given state of dialogue.A policy includes three parts, namely, trigger conditions, operational parameters and the content of the responses.Here's an example of a dialogue in a hotel reservation to look at these three parts.The first is the triggering condition.The trigger conditions for policy define the conditions under which this policy will be chosen.Here, for example, we have defined a policy trigger, which is intended as a hotel reservation, a slot for hotels, rooms and times, with a status 001.So, when the dialogue system is in 001, the user typed out the phrase “to make a reservation for today's Beijing as a landmark at the land store”.Through our natural language understanding of the service, we have been able to interpret the intention to book hotels and to include three words slots: hotel, room type and time.So the policy that defines this trigger is going to be selected for execution.The second component of Policy is operational parameters.It defines the parameters to be used in the logical processing of this dialogue.The parameters here may be the word slot value or the result of the function execution.Here the developers can define the logic of dialogue processing, the acquisition of parameters, access to external services or executive functions, and the data required for our dialogue response.For example, we have defined three variables, one for a hotel, the other for a room, the other for time.Finally, a variable of a function type is defined.This function makes hotel reservations based on the first three variables and then assigns value to this variable to the intended result.The last part of Policy is the output definition.Each output of policy consists of three parts.The first part is conditionalities.Specifies the conditions to be met by using the current output.The second part is the outcome of the dialogue.It can be filled to the template using the business parameters that we have previously defined, and it can generate a voice return.The third part is state update.It designates a new state of dialogue that our system should enter after this policy process has been completed.At the same time, it can also preserve parameters for subsequent rounds of use.In this example of dialogue, we first judge whether the hotel booking results are one, that is, whether the bookings are successful or not.If intended to succeed, then return the corresponding typhus and specify that the current state of dialogue needs to be updated to 003.Okay, we've just described how individual policy is defined.So how does policy work in DM Kit's actual operation?Let's take a look at DM Kit's service structure.At the heart of DM Kit is a dialogue management engine.On this engine, every skills dialogue process is defined by a json document, which actually includes a series of policy.During the operation of DM Kit, each request first visits the cloud's configured skills to obtain the resolution results.Then, on the basis of the skills ID and the results of the analysis, DM Kit found the corresponding policy in the matching skills json file.In addition, the parameters of the function type can be defined in the policy that we described earlier.The function here needs to be defined and realized in DM Kit.DM Kit contains a number of commonly used functions as shared functions, including the operation of requesting external services to interpret data.All skills are directly accessible.At the same time, developers can also customize functions and call according to actual business needs.Here is a detailed description of the configuration of DM Kit and how it is used.DM Kit's code is open and hosted on GitHub.In practice, the developers are configured to achieve most of the dialogue process management.DM Kit's configuration files are all under the code conf directory.From the top to the bottom, the first document is bot_tokens.json.Developers can register the api key and secret key matching cloud skills in this file.So you don't have to bring access to DM Kit when you ask for it.Under the demo directory are the policy profiles of the two demo scenes that we provide.The json files for each scene are the policy configuration that DM Kit actually loads.The xml document will be introduced later.Products.json documents are used for registration skills and for their corresponding policy profiles.Each skill requires that the corresponding skill ID and policy file paths be registered in this document, so that it can be properly loaded at the time of actual access.The remote_services_json file is used to configure the external service addresses required for the DM Kit service, including the UNIT cloud and third-party service addresses, and requires registration in this document in order to be properly accessed.The last gflag.conf files are mainly designed to configure the DM Kit service port, the request path and the number of simultaneous distributions.As a general rule, no change is required.The core of the DM Kit configuration is the configuration of policy.Each skill requires the configuration of a json file, which includes a series of arrays of policy.The syntax of the configuration of each policy element in the array is governed by the DM Kit definition.It mainly includes the trigger conditions, operational parameters and three parts of the output definition that we described earlier.Here we have a list of the main field descriptions.More information can be found on our official GitHub, for detailed documentation.A skills-based capacity for dialogue management can be achieved through the development of a policy profile based on the logic of actual dialogue.For some dialogue logics that require special processing or access to external services, this can be achieved by defining parameters of function type.After editing the skill profile, we also need to register this document and its corresponding skill ID in the profile of products.json.The developer can also register the skill api key and secret key in the configuration file bot_tokens.This allows DM Kit to automatically access to token when communicating with the cloud, and the user does not need to upload token again when requesting DM Kit.Okay, so what are we gonna do to test the impact of this skill when we're done with the pre-editing of the policy file?First, we need to download DM Kit's code from GitHub and complete the compilation.Replace the configuration file under the compiled output directory with the configuration file that was pre-edited for us after completion of the compilation, and then run DM Kit.DM Kit's service configuration is modified by the gflag file under theconf directory, which contains the port and path of the service request.Normally, we can use the default configuration.When DM Kit runs, we can test the dialogue by accessing the DM Kit service interface.DM Kit's interface protocol is compatible with the dialogue interface protocol of UNIT 2.0.The developers will be able to assemble json data according to the protocol and have regular access to DM Kit services.In addition, we have provided Python scripts, which users can use to simulate and interact with local DM Kit services.The premise of our operations, of course, is that the skills of the UNIT cloud are well-trained and functional.Let's end with a visualization configuration tool for DM Kit.We described earlier how the policy is configured to manage the dialogue process.DM Kit supports the editorial design of the dialogue process through visualization tools in response to the multiplicity and complexity of dialogue.The visualization tool here we use open-source mxgraph, specifically covering the following four steps.As a first step, we edit the dialogue process on the Draw.io website in accordance with predefined editorial rules.After step two edits the dialogue process, we export the dialogue flow chart to the xml file under the DM Kit configuration directory.We've seen the xml file of the demo scene, which we've been able to edit through this tool.Step three generates the json profile.DM Kit provided a conversion script.The developers run the langage_complier program under the run.py directory, which converts the xml file to the corresponding json file.Finally, the registration of this json file and the corresponding skill ID, following the same process as the previous one, will make it possible to run DM Kit loading and execution.We need to follow certain editorial rules when visualizing the dialogue process.This editorial rule is really very simple, and we've defined the following building blocks.The first is a single arrow line.It's used to connect other elements, to indicate the jump of the state.The second element is ellipse.Indicates the user node, which is used to store the user's dialogue intentions and the vocabulary.Corresponding to the preceding policy syntax is actually the trigger for policy.The third is a rounded rectangle.It is used to indicate BOT nodes in which parameters and BOT responses can be defined.The syntax corresponding to policy is actually policy's business parameters and output.The last one is a diamond.used to express a condition judgement.Enter a different output node when different conditions are met.Corresponding to the policy syntax is actually a condition limit in the output definition.Using several of the building blocks above, we can edit a complete flow chart of the dialogue.This, for example, is the complete flow chart of the hotel reservations that we described in the previous section.A detailed set of steps for this example can be drawn from the curriculum in chapter III above.Okay.This is all the content of this lesson.Thank you!</seg>
<seg id=9>All right, that guy just spoke very well.And then I went on to this, uh, conversation, and I went on to talk to you.And, uh, you get into that UNIT platform, and we can first enter the unit.baidu.com's front page on the UNIT platform in the browser, and then click " use " from the first page, and then enter the real management page on the backstage of the UNIT platform.In the UNIT platform, we define the range of things that a robot can handle as a scenario.That scene usually corresponds to a robot that handles specific tasks.So, uh, for your convenience, I'm using robots to replace the scene.Well, what we're going to look at here is a practical example of how to create a robot on our UNIT platform that is, um, capable of handling actual tasks.Okay, well, that's the first step, so you can name the robot after the "new scene."So, for example, we're building a robot called the Stars' Little Auxiliary to help us check the constellations.And then this dot "recognize" and then this empty robot is built.We're looking at a new layer.That's the description of this robot.And then it's got some fields that will show the robot's current state.Uh, then click on the view, and we can go into this configuration page of this robot.Uh, in the UNIT platform, robot configurations are divided into three parts.The first part is that we need to define what this robot can do.In the second part, I would like to define what knowledge I want to teach robots so that they can understand human instructions.The third part is to let the robots learn, digest and absorb this knowledge.And I went online to verify what the robot had learned, whether it had learned what we had taught it, as we thought it would.Uh, in the UNIT platform, each robot is made up of a single unit.Well, like that Cosine said, it's two or two parts.One part deals with dialogue and the other with questions and answers.Because this is a simpler scenario, looking at the constellation, we just need to build a dialogue module.Well, of course, if your robots are particularly complicated, you can go to the joints by a variety of units, OK.Well, here's an answer to a question by name, isn't it?Well, we're now defining what robots can do.It's obvious that there are two parts to be made, one that I define the user and what he might ask, and the other that I'm the robot to answer under what circumstances.The part where users ask, there were two concepts. I don't know if you've noticed.One is intent, one is word chute.So I'm going to quote here. The intention is, you're a robot that wants to do a major thing, what's the main thing.The second is the chute, which is about what conditions you need to do this.In the case of constellation traffic inquiries, it is clear that this is what the constellations are looking for.I can name it by a simple name, Luck-Search, and then add an alias, a motion query.So I've got a clear definition of the main area in which I live.Well, the second condition is that, well, we usually say, until we find out what the constellation is, what your constellation is, and when you're going to check it again, right?That would require two conditions, one for his constellation name and the other for the date on which his number was to be searched.Oh, in the UNIT platform, we're doing it through this vocabulary.The first, for example, on the condition that we now want to create a constellation name, let's have a name, which we now use in English to represent.And then you clarify that when the user does not describe what constellation he is, you can add a counter-question, for example, which constellation you want to search for?And then the next step.Uh, we know that constellation numbers can be listed.We know that constellations are about 12 constellations.A dictionaries for the number of users can be uploaded in advance.Well, I don't show the dictionaries here, but it's 12, uh, maybe 12 dictionaries.And then the next step.So this constellation is so simple that the slot for the name of the constellation has been established.The second is that users let us say some dates.But these dates are clearly different from constellation names, and they cannot be listed.If you want to enumerate the time, as we have previously understood the task of this natural language, it is clearly unlikely.However, in order to be user-friendly, the UNIT platform uses this level of capacity as equivalent to allowing users to directly re-use the capabilities placed in our system.So we call it the "user_date" condition.And the question is, "What day are you looking for?" OK.Ah, let's look at the identification of many of these built-in phrases that are embedded in the UNOIT platform, including the video names, the names, the names of the institutions.The number does not require a user to pass on any word slot, but simply a simple tick.Now, for example, I'm going to do a constellation traffic query, and just pick one of the sys_times that our system provides, that's the time of the user count, and then a little bit of the next step, OK?So I've already defined this part of what users want to ask.Let's look at it again, 'cause it's probably more than that right now.In fact, if you really do it, it'll be about a minute or so before you can define the part of the user's question.And the second part is the scene response, and that's what we robots say.Now, let's start with a simple word, "Okay, let's find out."Well, we know that when it is possible to actually do an application, in addition to that language, we have to add a part of this resource query.When we do a constellation search, for example, you obviously need to find out what happens to this, uh, constellation of stars one day.At this point, it's obvious that before you go to the inquiry, you have to collect two conditions.And then, for the UNIT platform, if the two slots are necessary in your query, you can set some conditions to do it.Well, here we have a simple operation, so you don't have to go in here and add it, and you can click on the brain.That automatically generates two conditions, which means that the robots take it back for this inquiry only when the user makes his date clear and his constellation clear;If it is not made clear, further counter-questioning is what has just been done to clarify words.And then click to save.So that part of what I can do with a robot is clearly defined.You can look at it as a whole, which means that we've defined the user and what he might ask, and under what conditions my robot would answer.This is the first part, teaching this robot what to do.The second part is that I'm gonna have to prepare some knowledge to teach robots, and say, uh, you're going to learn in this way, and you're going to understand what I'm going to do.It's a matter of time. I'm going to pass on a sample of words that we used to make in the system.OK, well, let's see one example.What do you learn about robots?In short, the user said, "To check the constellation position," so what do we need to teach robots?One of the things I'm going to teach robots is to tell robots that the user's intention now is to check out “his movements”, and he's unconditioned.Just keep this simple and mark it.The second is that his user may say that he may have made his constellation clear about the Aquarius movement.So it's clear that he's going to do this or check it out, and he's going to do it on that condition, and he's going to have to mark it.Ah, something like that. If he looks at it today, he labels it as a big date.If this is a more complete one, perhaps the user will simply say, “I'm going to check the movement of the Taurus tomorrow”, and we will just tell the robot that the purpose of the user is to check the movement, and his two conditions, one is the Taurus, the constellation, and the other is that his date is tomorrow.Well, I made about ten, ten, ten, ten samples to teach the robots, and, uh, you're gonna do it when the user says those ten words.And then I'm going to use these 10 samples as an example of what we're doing today with the UNIT platform, which means that when the robot listens to these ten sentences, it actually learns more, and, uh, more than that.OK, when we define what robots do, what robots do in the configuration, and what robots can learn when I'm ready at the data centre, then there's only one thing we have to teach them.In the UNIT platform, we added a button to the training programming called the Training and Entry into Force Model.After selecting the sample that just uploaded, uh, click on the training.Just when the robot started learning to absorb this uh process.Because of the timing, I can show you something that we did exactly exactly the same.We can take a look at this before this.This configuration is exactly the same.There's no difference, it's just that its users ask us the same thing as its robot says to us.And its data centre and the samples it uses are just those ten words.Well, that's been trained successfully.Let's just drop the machine training.At this point, can we try this robot now learn something through these ten sentences?We can compare it.The right is its real robotics.On the left, let's add an example.I would like to ask, for example, the question of “surveillance”, which is clearly what I did not say in those 10 sentences.But robots have learned this thing, right?The robot says, "What day is your date?"OK, like I said now is uh, next Saturday.OK, it shows us that, in addition to knowing the intentions, it identifies the robot with this date and knows next Saturday.And then the question is, which constellation are you looking at?Okay, let's add another white sheep.OK, so that's how it's done with a erm... and it's done with a certain query of this kind, which we call satisfaction, and it's done.Uh, yeah, it's a multi-cycle example.Let us give another one-wheel example of how robots can answer when we explain all the conditions in one round.Well, you're supposed to be able to see those ten words, aren't you?Check the constellations.Check the sign of the white sheep.Check today's movement.Let me assume that I would like to say one word now, to tell me about the scorpion of Scorpio next Sunday.That's obviously to the right, and I've never told a robot this side that that's what I'm talking about, and the robot understands that, right?Try it.Robots can fully understand that.It knew that this man wanted to check his movements and that his constellation was Scorpio and that his date was next week.Um, can I, uh, look again at what the developers can do with the UNIT platform if they look at next Sunday?It defines next morning to that specific date, 3 December 2017.Everyone can go check it out.It's also one of the functions of UNIT, which is special.Well, we just saw this proof page, just to make it easier for the configuration to see his robotic effects.And, actually, when you're done, it's a complete back-office service for us, which can be called in the form of an API.In addition to this API form, we are now connected to this 100-degree Dueros operating system.All you have to do is set this up on a UNIT platform, set up a robot and post it to this Dueros.Of course because Dueros may have to have some vetting.Once approved, you can enter the skills store on the Dueros shop at UNIT UNIT.I've just demonstrated that this is the case of the Constellation Auxiliary, which we've actually posted to that Dueros skill store.And then this is the configuration process of a simple one-scenario set-up of the eUNIT platform.Okay, the one who gave us the stage.Okay, okay.Thank you, Xiaoming!Well, at the end of the day, I would like to briefly describe the entire course of our development.On July 5, we completed the launch of the entire UNIT platform.In four months, we actually did a lot of upgrades.As we can see on 5 July, in fact, we only published such an understanding, which is the dialogue module.And then, at the beginning of August, we released our SDK.And then it can be tied directly with our SDK and voice.And then we can post the amount that can be added to this i SDK, which actually includes the IOS version of IIS, and the Andre version.Then, by September, we completed the entire question-and-answer session that we were talking about.And then we did a distribution of the whole shared function.And then, in October, the formalization of our verbs went on the line, and that is to say, you don't have to define them in a single verb.It's about how it can be defined in some regular expressions.And in addition to that, our 100-star developer competition was successfully concluded.Then we should end up with more than 700 teams, then 200 teams, and we end up with eight teams winning.And then, in November, that's the month.This month, two big things.The first thing is that Dueros, which we've just seen, is an arithmetic line that actually means that one of our 100-degree dialogue platforms, one of which is an ecological system, and the other of which is actually a technology system, one of which connects to one of these two platforms.And then, we're at the 100th World Congress, and although we're not doing a lot of publicity on that one, we can look at the financial one, a voice transfer function that we're working with the farm, and it's published on that one.And then, the gold medal sale we just saw in a smart customer's dress was also posted in that place.Besides, some of the smart things on our smart airport are some of the question-and-answer robots on that airport, which were also released there.So, actually, we've been doing this as a 100-degree brain to support some of the 100-degree conversational understandings.And then what's actually going to be interesting, that's when we were in December.I will now tell you very clearly that, first of all, we can support commercial deployments.And then in December, and then, then, we actually run the whole backstage API, which is that you can do some of the words in the API way, some of the training triggers, and so on, and so on, we'll publish some of the APIs next month.And then, and then, we talk about Bot, and you always want to talk about Bot, and then this chat Bot comes out next month.And beyond December, next year we will actually write about those points that I have just written, and in fact our overall planning should be within Q1 and Q2.Then we begin with a very significant upgrade of our QU and DM capabilities, if anything.I'll give you some details.For the time being, it is kept secret.Then the other is our entire training architecture, that is, if the stability and survival of our training as a whole are the efficiency that came into effect, we will have a very important reform, and that will be done around the beginning of next year.And then some of our more data management capabilities will be upgraded and adapted in the data centre.And that's all going to be done by the beginning of the year or eight.And then there's more and more.Because my entire schedule of projects has already drawn several pages.And then I'm just showing you what's the fastest thing to see in there.Yeah, some of these abilities are going to be under all of our development engineers, and it's going to be quick to meet you, isn't it?And then, uh, so it's just that our platform, although it's just been on the line for more than four months, actually we're a very dynamic and fast-growing one.And it is to be hoped that you will be able to come and use it more, and then go and give us more ideas and suggestions about its use, which will facilitate our entire platform to move forward more quickly and better.You know, there's a lot of technology in here, but it's all our developers' feedback to our side.And then we line it up quickly, and then we go make it, wow.And then, uh, you can see the web site of our UNIT platform, which you've just seen, unit.baidu.com.You can all come up here and try it out.And then, actually, we're going to have an important partner in 100-degree UNIT, Mr. CTO Chen Jianhow, to share with us.Okay, there you go.</seg>
<seg id=10>The political struggle in the workplace is a hot topic.What we often talk about is the political struggle of state corporations, but there are many friends who ask me, "Didn't foreign companies fight? Didn't foreign companies fight?So what I think is that the basic premise of the political struggle between foreign and private companies is that the management of the company serves the board, and the board of directors of the company is the owner of the business.For the owners of the business, the most important thing is for the company to make a profit, and secondly, for you to make a difference and not to break the law.So, under certain conditions, its struggle is basically governed by some of these rules.However, the situation is somewhat different in the case of State enterprises, whose management is accountable to the government departments represented by the National Investment Commission.So what this government is asking for is not just profit, but whether your company promotes social harmony and stability, or whether it solves the employment rate in society, especially in the case of some of the seven great-grandmothers.It's more complicated.So the pattern of political struggle between private and foreign companies is completely different from that of State corporations, mainly because of the system of ownership.We Chinese do not like the struggle, and all that is mentioned is the dark, dirty, mean means of fighting.For example, some words, such as a brawling war, a sit-in-the-hog fight, all described the struggle as very low and invisible.And the Chinese philosophy of virtue is not recommended for you to fight, but rather for a hermit philosophy like that, which is tacit and intransigent.You know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, like, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you like, you like, you know, you know, you like, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, like, like, when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when you know, you know, you know, like,There's a lot of people in the study with a big ninja poem, like they think they're very educated.But such a downside philosophy is highly incompatible with the spirit of modern corporate civilization.And in modern commercial civilization, what we need is expertise.So what's a professional?Maybe you'll think I've done my job. I'm a professional.I'm telling you this is a very childish idea.For a professional, you have to be able to do your job.That is a basic premise.Then it's more important that you get yourself a threshold that will allow you to do this.First of all, if you don't have the power to do this, you'll get kicked out before you get a chance to do it.So for a professional, not only do you have the capacity to do your job, but you have the power to do it for yourself, and you have the ability to do it for yourself.Because if you can't do these things, your leadership will think that you're a person with insufficient combinations.Here, I would like to raise a number of misunderstandings in the workplace about the struggle in the workplace.The first misunderstanding is that we do business without fighting.Such an idea is a silly and naive one, and it is a universal one for many hard-working business people.It's just that I've done my job, and I'm not gonna get involved in any of that open and secret fighting, and I'm gonna be safe.I can very simply clean up the snow in front of my own door, and I don't want to get involved in anything else.But there's a lot of people who blame people for it. Why?Because he found himself capable of doing business, but the company's business was not as good as the other, but was better at fighting.And he's only being paid to do some assistant work.That's why he's starting to feel like he's not pregnant and he's starting to feel like he doesn't fit in with this company.I'm surprised at this moment. Why don't you go out there and fight for yourself if you feel like you're capable of doing business?Why don't you go and get yourself a platform to use your abilities?Here I have to give an example of a woman I admire very much.And that's what we've just seen, and this is what she's an ad in the American play "The Advertiser."The woman, then, was a secretary, because in the 1960s, because of widespread gender discrimination in the United States, many women had come out to work and had to take on such junior positions as secretaries.But this talented woman, when she was in the position of secretary, came up with some very interesting advertising ideas, and then she got a client with an independent advertising idea.After this, did the company raise her salary?Nothing.That's normal, because every boss is self-serving.If you can hold the secretary's salary in the secretary's position, you can do a job for me in advertising.Then my company is making money!But she didn't want to be bullied like this.She found her leader and said to her, "I have two demands. First, you have to change my title to an advertising case, and second, I want my own office like any other advertising case."Her request was met.So let's imagine what she would have done if she hadn't made those two requests, or if she had done her secretary's work on the desk of the secretary in front of the doorman, with her secretary's salary.I'm sure she'll miss her, and she'll hate her.Will she still have her creative talent in advertising?Her talent is bound to be buried because she's angry, and her creative passion will be depressed.So if she doesn't fight for her rights, her talents are suppressed, and the company loses a brilliant advertising case, which is the result of a defeat.So, in a case like this, if you are good at fighting for your own interests, good at fighting for your position, it is good for the company.So I would like to take a second general misunderstanding of the political struggle in the workplace: the idea of giving me a title gives me real power, and it's stupid and naive.We often meet people out there who have business cards with general managers, president directors and even directors.You talked to him carefully but found that this person had no human rights or financial rights, and that he could not even be interviewed by a journalist because the headquarters did not allow him to express any opinion about the media.He could only distribute those press releases that had been distributed by Headquarters and could not provide any other explanation.Such a man, despite his title, is actually doing a very ordinary business manager's job.This kind of thing is quite common.So I can tell you something like that in one of my very familiar trades, fashion magazine, for example.Ah, let's take a look at the cover of these beautiful fashion magazines. Do you know who ordered the cover?Which one of the stars could put on this cover? Which model could put on this cover? Who should have ordered this?Maybe you'll say, "It's the editor-in-chief."One might say, "It's the editor."I can tell you, a lot of editors don't have the permission to shoot the cover.Because there's always someone on top of him who says to him, "You're not good, I'll help you."But the question is, who will be responsible if you use the cover you got from the top, and these magazines don't sell well?Of course you're the editor-in-chief, and since you enjoy the title, you have to take responsibility for it.But then you'll find out, "I didn't take this cover. Why should I be responsible for it?"Then your general manager would say, "Why don't you fight for the title?"So if you call back and say, "I'm being treated unfairly!"It's your problem to give you a title without the ability to get a corresponding mandate.In fact, one of the most recent news events has said the same thing: the struggle between Zhang Xian and Zhang Weiping for each other.As director-in-chief, Zhang Xian will think I don't want to set up this bed show, and it's not fair to me that your investors put me on this bed show.That's actually the problem with some directors' control of a project, of course it's complicated.But the problem is universal.Because the operator always wanted the project to make more money, but as a producer, your bottom line was that I couldn't compromise the quality of the work.If, as a total player, you do not have the ability to control the quality of another product that interferes with it, you can only point to your own operational problems.That is my second misunderstanding.The third misunderstanding about the struggle in the workplace is that it is all a conspiracy that is unconscionable.Here, I have to mention the famous Miyagi play of the past.The Queens of the Queens fight with each other more often than with the Emperor, and who can remove the child from the tummy of the Queens of the other.So what they often say is, "It doesn't matter if you did it, but it's the Emperor's belief that you did it."In this typical human-led environment, there can only be conspiracies and improvisations in a one-person environment, because there are no rules to follow.Because this man is an emotional animal, and he always changes.If it is to be implemented as a regulation, as he pleases, you can only fight conspiracies.So what we're promoting is fighting in the sunny pattern.We are also pleased to see that many of China's current struggles in the workplace are slowly moving towards the sun, such as the battle between the United States and the United States of America, and, more recently, between the war on Hahaa and the war on Taeen.Then maybe someone would say, "There's a conspiracy between them too!"That only means that we are not as perfect as we are in the construction of some systems and regulations, which are constantly being refined through this constant struggle.The battles within all our companies can move towards a sunny and institutionalized one, so that our society as a whole can progress even further.A misunderstanding that I would like to end with about the workplace struggle is that all the struggles are destroyed and not built.Let's take a look at these two women, one of whom is a representative of the People's Council and one of whom is a member of the Council of Political Ministers.By definition, these two positions are also a profession and a very important one.Moreover, for them the profession is not full-time, but at least it is part-time.So the two practitioners, together, followed one rule: "Oh, I will not abstain, I will not vote against, and I will only vote in favour."I was shocked when I saw the news.Because I think they're good at this job, and my three-year-old daughter can do it.I can say to my daughter, "Sit there, and raise your hand when someone raises your hand." That's it!I think they probably forget what it's about. It's about talking to the people!The job is to make our society a step forward!So from this perspective, they're actually malpracticed.They had nothing to do with it, and they should leave the post.What we are advocating is a business-fighting political struggle in the hope of fine-tuning the rules through the struggle of each and every one of us in order to bring our struggle to the sun.You fight because you are right!I appreciate his attitude.Because I think if each and every one of us can fight what we think is right and put what each and every one of us thinks is right on a bright table, then we find: Huh? I think it's right, he thinks it's wrong; he thinks it's right, I think it's wrong.So let's put all these ideas together.Through communication, through compromise, through the elaboration of more detailed rules, each one of us has the right, every one has the right thing to be fully respected, and our society, our companies, our industry will move towards a brighter future.So you're ready?You fight because you are right!Thank you.</seg>
<seg id=11>“The things in the world are easy, and so are those who are hard, and those who are easy will be hard.”This sentence should be very familiar to you.It's from an article in our middle school textbooks called "For Learning".It makes a very simple point. Is it difficult and simple to do things in this world?If you do, the harder it becomes simpler; if you do not, the simpler it becomes harder.Does something like this happen around us all the time?We've had a lot of dreams since we were young. How many things have you achieved?At the 2010 Expo, I saw a story about a little girl in the American Pavilion called Ryan.A sanitary corner of a building waste dump was found in her neighbourhood.She wondered if it was possible to turn this sanitary corner into a beautiful garden through her actions.She's on the move.She put flowers out of her house and planted them in that sanitary corner.But when she turned around and took the second pot, the flower was stomped on by the hipsters of the community.But she didn't give up.And again and again and again and again and again.In the end, she moved the apathy of her neighbours in the community to complete with her the plan for the construction of this beautiful garden.More than that, the entire community grew flowers on the balcony for every household, making the community spring.I don't know if you're feeling anything when you look at this movie, and I feel like, "Oh, is this happening in our country? Is this happening in the community I live in?"In June 2011, I went to Shenzhen for a volunteer project.I went to a beautiful beach in Shenzhen, in South Australia, called West Shore Beach.The beach is just home because it is a beach that has not yet been fully developed commercially.Young people in the area prefer to camp on the beach, with tents on a coastline like this one kilometre long.We call it a Chinese camp. What's a Chinese camp?You can guess.When they leave, they'll leave a lot of stuff behind. What?Garbage.Yeah, they're gone, leave that piece of garbage behind.Some even bury their garbage with sand.That could get people in the back on their feet.I went swimming, and when I saw this, I hesitated.Can I swim?A wave up, a bubble bowl down.A wave came up and a bunch of cigarettes went down.If I go swimming, breathe, half bowl of noodles, breathe, three cigarette butts.Can't swim.At this point, do I choose to go away, or do I choose to act?I think about the little girl in Ryan. I want to move.I want tourists on the beach to clean up this beach with me.I began to observe that there were teams on the beach that were pulling out the camp.So I ran up front, and I helped them to draw the camp, and I watched who was their leader.There's a girl named Zhang, "Ah, don't forget anything."Oh, it's supposed to be a little boss.I went up there to use our Shanghai boys' advantage to carry her bag.And then help them put the bag at their assembly point, and when she put it down, she thanked me, "Thank you. Which group are you in?"Oh, she told me that they weren't really a unit, that maybe they were all coming together.We don't know each other well.I said, "Oh, I'm not with you. I'm a tourist.""Wow, that's very kind of you.""But I have an identity today. I'm a volunteer.""Volunteers? What do you do?"“I am in a more special position today as a volunteer recruiter.”"Recruiting volunteers. What are you doing?"And I said, "Well, it's nice to get rid of all the garbage when you leave, but don't you think this beach is dirty?""Ah, it's dirty.""Can you stay with me for an hour for a beach cleaning volunteer?""Well, it may not be convenient, because we're gathering for dinner right now, and after dinner we have a training session, we don't have time, and our boss is not here, and the boss is going to contact the bus."Reject.I said."Well, I'll bet you that if I win this bet, I'll ask you to come with me to pick up the garbage; if I lose this bet, I'll go pick up the garbage alone."I don't really expect people to be willing to bet on me.I just wanted to be able to know that I was a volunteer who didn't give up easily, just so you could continue to be attracted to my goals.I went back to my place to get a game that we developed ourselves.This game, it's called green chess, and it's about caring for the environment and low-carbon travel.And I said to all of their companions on that day, "If any boy can tear the board of my game, I'll lose, and if you can't tear it, I'll win."A couple of boys up here, they won't tear it up.Yes, because I made this board with a special material.Obviously this bet I won.That's when their boss came.Their boss came up, and I said, "Hey, boss, can you do me a favor? Organize your team for an hour and we'll volunteer."The boss said, "Oh, I'm so sorry. We don't have time."Still refuse.I said, "Can you do it for half an hour?""Oh, I'm so sorry. The bus has arrived and the air conditioning is on.""How about 15 minutes?""Well, let's talk about it."But at this point in time, because of my constant efforts, many of their companions have actually been moved.One of the boys jumped out, "Oh, 15 minutes, let's go!"In his words, he touched all of them and eventually all of them joined me in my action.It took me almost 15 minutes to get 30 people into my garbage collection, and they were very happy.It's not just that, because in 15 minutes, Shanghai people still have a more faithful character.How can I finish that long coastline?But at this time, I'm not the same as I was before.You can see the pattern at the lower right corner.There's a two-metre-high platform on it, and there's 20 people sitting on it, and they're going to spit on the beach.And I went up and I said, "Hey, guys, can we go ahead and give you this piece in front of you?""Who are you?""We volunteer, y'all."There was a young man up there, and I guess his English name was Jack, because he jumped off it.As soon as he jumped off, a girl next to him, whose English name was probably Rose, jumped.You jump, I jump.When these two jump, 30 of us look up, and the 20 get high, and I'm sorry, they're all coming down from above.Fifty men with me are picking up garbage.Picked up the later boss's special pleasure to bring the garbage together and take a photo.You might think it's over.Actually, no.And I asked the boss, and I said, "Hey, boss, today we're going to get this garbage. Will this beach be clean tomorrow?"The boss says, "Well, maybe it's possible, maybe it's impossible."And I said, "Well, look, we have a wall behind us, a wall of grey, and what do you think if we do another activity, do this wall for environmental graffiti, and advocate for all who come to live up to the idea of protecting the environment on the beach?"The boss said, "That's great. Our team will draw."And I said, "Okay, I'll work with you, I'll take care of the paint, you take care of the people."Are you looking forward to the results in a month?A hundred volunteers came back a month later and drew a 36-metre wall.The story isn't over yet. They're having too much fun.Six months later, they felt that the map was too implicit six months ago.Upon return, a 50-metre wall was found, drawing the words “and the fish become friends and take the garbage with them”.A lot of people said, "Hey, Zhang Ning, we can't do this. You're the only one who can do it. You're such a fool."In fact, we often do volunteer activities, and we often hear that.What's got me out of action?It's like, "Ah, there's no one to support it. I can't do it alone.""No one supports me, no one does anything for me."Someone else, someone else.I'll tell you a story about our volunteers.This volunteer, Wang Yin, is a Shanghai man at the age of 30.She became our first volunteer for "100 Days of Smile"."Smiling 100 Days" is what we've got volunteers to do in poor mountain areas to help children read happily.It's been there for 100 days.She's going to Guizhou, a very remote place, where there's no car.She's not well, she's weak, she has to walk the mountain every day.When she had this idea, she told her family that she could have known her family's opposition.Please see a video.She's there. I'm sure they'd like to know if her mother was there for her at the end.When she got to Guizhou, her mother couldn't really get over it.Her mother's friend said to her mother, she said, "You're lucky that your child has a dream and can do such a bitter thing; my own son, all the roads have been arranged with him, but he's not happy, and eventually he's depressed."When she wakes up, her mother says to Wang Yin, "Be safe, and do what you like to do."More than that, when Wang Yin arrived in Guizhou, many of her friends heard that she was volunteering.He's been calling for money at her house, charging her cell phone, telling her, "We can't go, I hope you'll have fun with the kids for us."Indeed, all those who oppose are constantly helping us to think about what the real meaning of our actions is.You need someone else's support, and it's not because you're handsome and pretty, because you live up to the meaning of what you really do.So as long as you act, as long as you prove your direction right with your actions, you will naturally have a lot of people to support you.This is a situation.There's another situation.This volunteer, Wu Hae-gang, is from Malaysia.Ten years ago, he watched a public service ad on television and told a story about a Western tutor.He's particularly touched.He thinks I'm going to Yunnan to be a teacher.He told his wife at the time that she was against it.The family objected, "That's the age. Don't mess with it. Protect yourself."And then he didn't know where to find a channel for such a teaching, and he said, "Okay, just wait."After 10 years, he thought I couldn't wait any longer.He said to me, "I'm getting closer and closer to the other end of my life, and I may not be able to wait any longer."He's done something since last year.What's going on?He told everyone, "I have this dream. I'm going to Yunnan to teach. Who can help me?"A friend of mine introduced him to me, and he came to me and said, "Chang Ning, I want to teach."I said, "Why do you want to teach?"He said, "Ah, I'm from China, but I think I'm Chinese.I want to immigrate to Yunnan to be with the child so that they can receive a fair education.”I was deeply touched by his words.I said, "Well, I didn't do a side project, but you touched me, and I helped you."I've found four other public service institutions, a smiling library, a dedicated library, a public English library, and Yongning.Together with Brother Kong, we planned such a wonderful volunteer project called "100 Days of Smile" according to his needs.They go, let the children go into the ocean of books, make them really like them in a happy way.The teachers told us that you really helped the kids and helped us ease the burden.Volunteers are happy, teachers are happy, children are happier.I've told four stories before.Didn't you see that there was actually one thing in common?When we have ideas, when we are ready to act, we have nothing.We didn't say I gave you the money, we didn't say we went with you, but we did.Because we know that action will bring us everything we want.Wang Yin said a very good word.She said, "I've had a lot of bad times in my life, but I'm going to Yunnan and Guizhou very well."What's the matter?She said, "As soon as I left, I found myself like a solid-energy succulent, and all the resources came towards me."I am very pleased today that the host of the two stories was invited to the scene.Welcome to Wang Yin and Kong.Well, hello, everybody.I'd like to say, "I want each of us to find the path of light in our hearts, to take firm steps. Let's go!"“And tomorrow it will be yesterday, and now it will be.”"Let's move now!"</seg>
<seg id=12>Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah!And it's really exciting to see so many people, and it's just that we're all so passionate.And then, actually, what we've just seen is that we've got a lot of speech technology ahead of us.In other words, what is actually in the middle of it is what it is that gives you, that is, a technology that translates our words, what we say, into words.And on my side, it's actually behind the voice, and we've been quiet in the back.What we are going to solve then is how some of the elements in this text can be properly understood so that the machine can truly understand what it means.So, I'm here today on the topic of “UNIT Language Understanding and Interactive Technologies”.Then let's look back. What the hell is Al?It's actually simple.We've come up with a concept like AI since the 1960s.After all these decades, in fact, we have been doing the exact same thing that scientists and computer engineers have been trying to do — to give the machine a human capacity.So he needs to let, what kind of human power do we want the machine to have?First of all, we're going to have to be able to speak.We have to make it possible for robots to hear and speak.And beyond that, we need to be able to understand the image.As we have just described, it can read people, and it can draw certain images.And secondly, it needs to have language skills that enable the machine to understand this language, which are some of the actual meanings behind it.And finally, we expect the machine to have the capacity to do something that it can do autonomously.And at a deeper level, we actually expect the machine to have the ability to think first, to think and to reason like we human beings.Beyond that, we expect that the machine will have the knowledge, for example, that it will be able to accumulate a great deal of knowledge like our human race, and that it will be able to apply it throughout our thinking.And then, of course, in the end, we need to give the machine a very important ability to learn.So what's in the middle of these abilities is actually that I'm going to focus today on language skills.Let's take a look at it. Why do we mean that you've been investing a lot of energy in language-related artificial intelligence technology?Indeed, the most central problem is that we consider language to be such a vehicle of thought and knowledge.Why is language the vehicle of thought?In fact, one can imagine that much of what we think now, much of what we say, is actually in the form of language.So it actually includes the fact that some of the relevant reports are being made to you now, and I'm also conveying my thinking through language.And beyond that, we actually think that language is the vehicle for condensing and passing knowledge.You can also look at some of these graphs, from the most ancient to the engraving of Lake Ja, and then all the way to Oracle to an Internet figure such as the one that has evolved to the present.The form of the knowledge carry has been changing and is constantly escalating.And even then we might have more of these loads.But what's the only thing that doesn't change? It's language.It allows us to understand our knowledge.We have 5,000 years of culture.So we have more and more cultures that can pass through these thousands of years of barriers all the way to the present.They're probably all the same.So we can think of language as a very important part of artificial intelligence.So in an era like today, what do we expect to do?Indeed, we have entered an era of artificial intelligence, and of course we expect languages to play a very important role here.So what kind of a character is that?Indeed, in recent years we have been raising such a concept as the so-called “dialogue as a platform”.And that is actually what is expected of us to interact directly with the machine in the form of dialogue, then to enable the machine to understand what we say and, at the same time, to enable the machine to say what we expect it to say.Let's start with a video.How's the weather today?It's clear today.Kodo-chan, go to the Beijing Garry Center.Find three routes.Which one?The first one.How long before you get to your destination?One hour and 29 minutes from the destination.Kodo-chan, I'm going to Yoyo City.You've been set up to drive to Yoyo City.What do you want to eat later?Hotpot.All right!A small search of the nearby fire pot shop.Navigator to number one.The first one.Start navigation.Doo-Doo, I'm going to put some gas on the road!A driving route through the gas station has been planned.Uh, it's already online.If you open the 100-degree map, you'll be able to use it.And why would I put a video like this in here?In fact, this is actually a very critical technology, which is that, through dialogue, we just need to talk, and then we can easily control what we have, a device like this, and then let it implement all the directives that we expect it to carry out.It actually includes some dissipation with fingertips, and then we have multiple rounds of dialogue, and then we have some understandings in various languages and even some generalizations in my various expressions.Some of these capabilities are actually one of the technologies that works for some of our core NLP identifiers, and this technology is actually supported by our UNIT platform.So what you've just seen is that all of us can get through our UNIT platform.So, after looking at such an example, let us look at in detail how the system of dialogue is actually made up.A conversation like that was actually how it was done behind our computer.It's simple, two big areas.The first area is voice.We say one thing, and then our voice recognition module will recognize it as a text.And then, actually, into an area like our NLP.And in this field, through a technique that we're going to understand in language, we're going to take out some of the core knowledge in a phrase like this, and we're going to take out its intentions.And then we're going to maintain a state of dialogue, and in many rounds of dialogue, we're going to merge this knowledge and then we're going to filter it out through these states that are our last movement.Then, through a module called NLG, the language of nature, we can all be able to put all that we just said, that our computers want to go, that we want to bring together some of the languages to be expressed by computers and some of the knowledge that we have retrieved, and then form a language that we expect to be expressed by computers.And then we synthesize it through TTS, and then we get the computer to say it.This is an integral part of a complete system of dialogue.Well, that's a really complicated set, because it actually involves a number of key technologies at the core.We've actually seen a number of different levels of technology at various levels of voice, including recognition and synthesis.And then, in NLP, you see a lot of these low-level technologies.At the bottom, in fact, it needs to rely on some basic terminological analysis, as well as on a large number of other types of behaviors and data that are users, in order to be able to learn a more fluid dialogue and generalization that we have just seen.So, actually, some of these technologies, if we don't have a particularly large research and development team, may be hard to get to a more perfect state.So, uh, but it doesn't matter, it's just that we're open.So we're opening up UNIT now in order to solve a problem that allows our vast developers to make it possible for our vast developers to build on a platform like ours to complete some of the configurations that we have just made.All we need to do is simply do a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of custom on this, and then we can give it a little bit of training material to do it.Then let's see what kind of support we actually have on this platform.First of all, we just talked about our technology.And then, then, we have some powerful ability to customize, and then what?We actually have some big data on our real size.The whole thing is packed in UNIT and made available to you.Then, if we want to, we can open up our technology and then we can give it to our products.And at the same time, it can create an ecological resonance with our vast developers.And in this, the most critical technology has two big parts.The first part is called the technology of language understanding, and the second part is called the technology of multiple rounds of interaction.And at the heart of this is that behind these two technologies is actually some of the underpinnings of our basic technology and basic data.Then we can take a closer look.First of all, we provide on this platform an understanding capacity that is oriented towards intentions and phrases.It's actually simple.The expression of such a user — query — is a text, and then our identification model will recognize it as an intention of a reserved restaurant.And then we'll take out some of the key information from here, and we'll take it and we'll take it down to one, for example, the name, the time and the number of people in the restaurant.And then, usually in a real application like this, users don't talk about all the key elements to robots.We can't just say, "We're going to the All-Counter tonight at 6:00," right?We usually go one step at a time to express our needs.So, such an expression is actually very important for us to express our needs as a whole.And then it's going to have to use a multi-wheel interactive technique like us.You can look at this example."Stand me a 10-person room in all of Judd."And then in the process, it actually didn't say when he wanted to order it.That's OK, it doesn't matter.Our robot will automatically answer the question and say, "What time do you want to book?"That's okay.All we have to do is say, "Oh, six o'clock tonight," and then we're done.And beyond that, one of the needs for a simple extension on the platform is recommendation.So, for example, can I say, "Do you need another car for that time?"Okay.We'll just have to get on top of it.Then, naturally, it would recommend such a volume dialogue to you and then guide users to some more customizations.So this and what is on the above page constitutes a capacity for a dialogue-oriented understanding of intent, of words, of which we were the first to offer at UNIT.Then there is another situation, where we have a lot of friends who actually often do.Which means I've actually collected a really big question-and-answer library like Question & Anwer.Then again, we do not expect some precise intent to be built on each issue.I'm just hoping that I'm putting this question-and-answer library in my system.And then, when the user comes, one is a new query, and I want to know, for example, how to apply.Then automatically we match some of the most semantic answers to his questions and recommend them to the users.And then it's a smart conversation that goes directly to such a customer service category or a consulting category.So that's a natural support for our UNIT, and that's one of the capabilities that we got online in the second phase, probably in September.Well, then, as I just said, all you need to do is pour some information like Question & Anwer directly onto our platform.And then, some of your related questions, some of the general questions you ask the user, come straight up, and it'll automatically go in here and search, and help us retrieve some of the most relevant results.Similarly, a question-and-answer base in the category of a customer service actually requires multiple rounds.Because when you use a user, sometimes he doesn't really know what he really needs.For example, when the user first came, he just wanted to know how to borrow, and he didn't know what you had.That's okay.We actually need to go a little bit through multiple rounds to guide.Such a dialogue would then be completed and a result would eventually be recommended to users.And some of those capabilities, too, are available on our platform.So you need to use our entire multi-round dialogue mechanism and our question-and-answer mechanism to simply put it together, and when you put it together, you can actually complete such a type of dialogue.So what has just been mentioned is that the first two are some of the two types of capabilities that we offer in the face of such a scenario as a level-intellectual dialogue.And then, actually, some of these capabilities are not just that we provide them in a static fashion, but that I can actually be defined on our own, through such a certain capacity of knowledge, interactive logic and model training in the field that we offer.Then you can go and train some of the models you need for your own business.And these models can actually do some of these customizations on this UNIT platform.Well, while the UNIT platform was in fact just released in July of this year, in fact we have accumulated a very long time in the hundreds.And so, uh, we're actually already in smart passenger clothes, assistants, homes, then cars, robots, so we all have some relevant accumulation on some of these scenes.And then you can go, and I can give you two simple examples, and see what other problems we can solve.Uh, a video, please.Hello.Ma'am, hello.This is the Credit Card Services Center, number 1005.Excuse me, do you have an innovative bank credit card in use?Nothing.The caller simply informs you that the Innovation Bank has launched a platinum credit card free of charge for life.The guarantee amounts to 20,000 to 100,000, and the country crosses borders and free deposites are free of charge.Because it's also a platinum card. Do you have any other bank credit cards for more than six months?Are you employees of the bank?This call is mainly about the annual free platinum card of the Innovation Bank.You will be contacted by the customer service manager of the Innovation Bank.I'm stuck too much.Ma'am, Cado says you're an old credit card user and you have good credit terms!Don't worry, I'm just introducing this card. It's not for you.There are also a lot of activities to celebrate this anniversary.You are specifically invited to participate.Why don't you get it?Did you use the credit cards of other banks for more than six months?Well, there is.That's for life.Yeah.If I had to, I'd go to the bank myself.Ma'am, you're usually at work. The bank counter doesn't always work.This will waste your precious time.Isn't that convenient?Excuse me.Do you have a steady job in Beijing?I don't have a job.Oh, well, that's fine, as long as there's a fixed income and a solvency, and you can be identified by a fixed phone.Do you have a regular monthly income?I'm retired.Oh, excuse me.Then I won't bother you.Thank you for listening.Have a good life.Bye.Well, that last one's still a failure.But in fact, we really expect to show you one such capacity.So this is one of our auxiliary sales systems.Then the caller and the person who answered the phone were actually real people.And then, but we often see a situation like this.Which means that some of our sales are worth a lot of money and you probably don't know if you know a business like this.That is to say that some of these sales are particularly good at doing some sales, and some of these sales, which are particularly appropriate at the right time, are not so many.And most of the sales are actually, when he comes in, he needs a long training period, and he needs to learn what we should say under what circumstances.And the cost and time of this training is really high.But in practice, one such function is actually provided by a system such as ours.That is, it actually doesn't need an in-depth training that we do too much on the phone, which dynamically takes into account these conversations between the two people, and then pops up some of the things that are best suited to say on this occasion.And then this sale just needs to read it out.This could in fact provide a great deal of success in increasing such a sale.And then, actually, when we were on the 5th of July, we were actually supposed to be the same developer race that we announced as a 100-degree star.And the whole platform behind such a big race is actually our UNIT platform.And then in this game, we actually have a lot of more interesting ideas.And this is an award-winning piece of our entire race.And some of the students who actually developed this piece are actually some of the students of some of the upper secondary schools.So you can come and take a look at this. Play the video, please.Recommended recipes.What kind of food do you want?We've screened out the recipes below.The dragonfish.How much time do you want to spend cooking?We've screened out the recipes below.Half an hour.Ready.The third step is to cut small pieces of lobster fish with two spoons of wine, a little black pepper and salted salt for 20 minutes.Give me ten minutes.We'll alert you in 10 minutes.Show me the picture!Next.Done. When.Well, you can see that this is a related technology that actually combines our voice recognition module and our entire UNIT.Such a semantic technique, followed by a team of about two or three students and built a product like this.And then it's very interesting.And then we can go a little bit further, which is to say that some of the technologies in the front are actually backstages of what kind of core technologies we support.First of all, we actually have the whole UNIT as a framework, which means that our developers just have to go up there to provide some of our targets and some of our training data, and then go into one of our whole learning.Then we just need to listen, uh, through our quick entry into force, sustained optimization and some of those capabilities, and then we can make our entire data model.And then a model like this could go straight up to the line and then give you such an interactive understanding service on the cloud.And what's at the heart of this is actually the kind of technology that we understand and match.We do not actually use just one set of technologies.We have, in fact, many sets of technologies that work together, including our pre-positioned capacity, our ability to take effect quickly and our ability to learn on a continuous basis.And these capabilities, if they are actually integrated, can provide some of these numerical functions that are very diverse in semantic understanding and generalization.Well, that's some of our more central elements, for example, what our intention is to identify, that is, a model of the neural network.It can be done under 2,000 or so words, and in the category of films and maps, we can be more than 80 per cent accurate.And then our semantic matching, actually, doesn't require you to just customize and train.I just need to put it in the big dictionary.Then, on the basis of some of the relevant semantic matching technologies among us, we can say that we have a query map of the next user's natural language, which is, um, this one, on a standard question like this one.And then, beyond that, data is actually a source of optimization for our entire model.So, on our platform now, we provide two kinds of mechanisms.One is the promotion of knowledge and the other is active learning.More relevant questions can be extracted automatically from 100 degrees of big data, then recommended to you and then offered to model machines for learning.And beyond that, we have some of the managerial capacities that are very rich in a dialogue process, including the intention to assemble, the intention to switch, the word slot to change, the clarification, the nesting, and so on.And then there are some of our bridging rules and some of our mechanisms of state memory.These are all offered on our UNIT platform.Well, let's see where we're going.Well, that means we were actually just released on July 5th.And then, in the process, we actually have a few related technologies to upgrade and publish each month.And by December, we should actually be that month, and our commercial deployment programme has actually been completed.And we can be consulted about some of the deployed capabilities that are more stable in commercialization.And then, we're backstage resource management API, and we're actually going to release it this month.Besides, one of our chatting bots and some of our related presets will be released this month.And then, next year, I can actually tell you a simple story about the 2.0 of our strategy, which will be completed by the beginning of the year.And what's going to happen with this online?Very simple.Well, I actually just got the effect of our final experiment yesterday.About 100 data, put it in our model, and then one of our real online products is one such scene.Let's assess its accuracy rate, which is more than 90 per cent and over 80 per cent recall.100 data, that can be done.And then this, we'll put it out for you at the beginning of the year.There is, of course, more than that.Some of our training structures, some of our data analysis and some of our ability to help you analyse user query, will all be open in due course next year.So you're welcome to come and use it further, and then give us some more feedback, which would also be to promote further upgrading of our platform.OK, let me show you the website, which is very simple, unit.baidu.com.And, uh, you're welcome to use it, all right?Okay!And that's where I'm going with my speech today.And then we have an excellent example of an orange interaction with 100-degree UNIT, an important partner of UNIT, Ms. CEO Lee Jiari.</seg>
<seg id=13>Let's start with marriage.At a great wedding, the bride's mother made a very strong and long statement to the bride and groom on the stage.She said, “The two of you come from different places and have different life habits, and now you form a family, and then you need to know that the future will do what you do to your children, and you need to know that the true meaning of this marriage is to accommodate each other, and that the marriage is 0.5 + 0.5 = 1.”After that, the guests here may have listened to it as you have said, and you will say, "Oh, this experience of years of this marriage has found the truth of the marriage."But wait a minute. Is this really true?Is real marriage 0.5 + 0.5 = 1?I was supposed to be a full one.If inclusion means turning 1 into 0.5, why should I enter into marriage in a society where we can live without marriage?So our intimate relationship study tells you that 0.5 + 0.5 = 1 is a product of a process in which we used to treat marriage as the ultimate goal of old age that could not be broken.But what we think is important today is that I want to be happy and grow up in marriage.So good intimacy must be 1+1 greater than 1 equal.But there's nothing wrong with this mother, because we do have to face all kinds of differences.For example, men and women, uh, parents are different from our children.One of our women's favorite games is a guess game.After many years of married life, our gentleman on our birthdays will ask us, "Oh, what gift do you want this year?"We said, "Whatever."We'll never tell him because we have to guess.Our husband often doesn't understand. He'll always be wrong.We are disappointed, because the highest level of love in our minds is that I say nothing about you knowing me, which means that you love me.But a man is an animal and he's strange, and he doesn't think like that.He said you didn't say anything about how I could know. I'm not a bug in your belly.So in marital life, because of this difference, it's in a long-term marriage.I'm hurt because we think you don't understand me. How can you do that? I don't think you love me.Marriage becomes bridal, so the problem of difference has to be solved by us.So I do anthropology myself, and I actually think that Mr. Fah-tung, when he's doing he's doing he's doing he's actually summing up a few words from his national studies, and I think it's the best interpretation of differences.It's called "The beauty of the beauty, the beauty of the beauty, the beauty of the life of the world."He came up with it in ethnology, and his philosophy is, "Well, every nation has its own standards, values and aesthetics.This value orientation and aesthetic standards are often wrong and even disgusting in the eyes of another people.So in the early days of national contact, it was often a powerful people who forced another people to adapt to me.In the process, ethnic conflicts continue to erupt, and there is no way in which people can live in harmony with each other.And at this point, we'll find, uh, after a lot of people's contact, we'll find out that your beauty and your values are different from mine, but it makes sense.In more exchanges, we'll find that it's not just that, but that one day I found out that your dances, your religious beliefs, are something that I would love.Then we continue to communicate with this further understanding, and we have reached the United States and the United States, and we begin to appreciate that difference.It is because of that difference and pluralism that we find the world so beautiful.Then we can truly achieve the harmonious society that our party leadership has proposed.This idea is used in family life, but it is exactly the same.It's just hard to say it's easy to do.Let us give a few examples.This one may have been recognized at first sight. This is our most famous hero of last year's pit daddy incident.But he was a very good young man, and his artistic talents were very, very good.His father, Li Zhejiang, once told me about his talent in an appointment.Ah, proud to say, I always wanted my child to grow free, and I wanted him to have the energy of love.I let him grow free so he could perform so well.He said that his mother was often demanding from him, and I told him that you were wrong and that the child could only develop his artistic talents if he was free to do so.But one day, when Li Tianichi had a lot of things to do, we started to say that you were wrong because you were wrong, so he put you in a trap because you were too fond of your children.But we look back.Isn't it right to allow a child to develop freely?We know that when a child grows up, he needs to know what the rules are, and someone needs to be very strict about what you should do, and that these rules must be respected.But at the same time, he also needs to give him space to grow freely.Both education is actually needed for a child.So it's not that love must be bad, it's not that strict education must be bad.It's not good to walk in extremes.But for a child, both types of education are needed.These two differences must coexist in a manner that does not wipe each other out and criticize each other.But this is the idea of beauty.We want the difference to exist because it has always been justified.But it's hard to do it, and I find it hard to do it myself.I'll tell you my own story.My kids got a math test when they went to elementary school, and I saw that they had 80 points in their school, and she didn't get 80 points.Then I'll say to the kid, "Hey, baby, let's analyze why you're wrong. Do we have any way of correcting these mistakes?"Ah, I'm very happy. I think I'm doing very well.Because I am an expert in this area, I did not criticize her.That's when my husband came back.He said, "Well, math is my specialty. Show me the kids' papers."He said, "Oh, what's wrong with this one, it's careless, it's not a mistake.""What's wrong with the title and what's wrong with it? Can you count it right? You can count it right. It's not a mistake."And lastly, he said you did 99 points.Ah, that's what I thought. How can you let the kid know she's wrong?But I also know it's wrong to say that the two of us are different and can't say it in front of the kids.Wait a minute, let me see the effect.As a result, our children's math scores have been going up.Because she's confident, and she thinks every time it's wrong, well, I can actually do better.At that moment, she needed both ways, but perhaps more importantly, confidence.So, I find this beauty to mean that people are different from you, and he's probably right.It's like we're different when we're in love and we're married.We found out before we got married that our husband was such a generous man, with brothers and friends; after we got married, we said why you didn't take care of your family and why you had so many things to do outside.It's just a feature that happens in different contexts.Before we got married, we found Mrs. Birdie, you listen to everything, and you're very pretty, and you're very happy; after we get married, you'll find out why this woman is so unable to do anything, and you're tired of depending on you.It's also a feature in different contexts.So the beauty of beauty is to say more about seeing that virtue.It's really hard for you to change a person because it's a characteristic thing.You just see what he's got, so he's often more likely to happen in the right areas.In practice, however, there are more benefits to be gained from differences.I've been living in America for a long time.Well, I'm not good at driving because I'm blind, and I know this traffic in America is very good, but I never thought I'd be driving.For me, that car on the American highway was a pretty scary thing.But last year, in October 2002, I went to Los Angeles with my husband for five days.Two days in the middle he said he was going to San Francisco once.As far as I'm concerned, that doesn't make it possible for the plane to fly.He said no, he had to rent a car to drive.Seven hours from Los Angeles to San Francisco, 14 hours back and forth.It's horrible for me to call back and forth in two days, 14 hours.I said no, I'm not going, but my husband says I'm going.Because he was with me in America, and he was with me for a meeting, and I guess he was with me, so I made a compromise, and then we rented a car to get on the road.As a result, I found the road from Los Angeles to San Francisco so beautiful and beautiful.It gives me a particularly unique feeling.My husband also told me in the car that he understood life in the United States, and I felt that some of your dreams were like this.Without my husband, without his differences with me, with my life, I would never have had such an attempt, and I would never have found that beautiful.But because of him, he's not like me, so I'm starting to have two worlds.When we encounter problems, there are two solutions.We give the kids two ways to say it.You get into any problem, Mom says, "Well, that's what you can do, Dad says that's what you can do."The kid said, well, you two have to combine the two ways to see what's better.Our lives are uniquely good and particularly interesting because of differences.This is the beauty of beauty after beauty.Well, at this level, we'll find out that the true intimacy is not about love, not about me being unable to live without you.It's just that I can live well without you.But I'm better off with you, and I feel better with myself, because you're better with me.At this point, the positive energy of intimate relationships can be fully realized.Because it is only when there is the power of love in intimate relationships that we are willing to deal with these differences.It is only when we continue to collide in intimate relationships that we know that the bottom line is here, that the compromise is here.The beauty was here, the harmonious relationship was there.We live here, and at the same time we can feel the wonderful view of the other side.From now on, let us learn to respect differences, enjoy differences, feel diverse and enjoy a good life.Thank you!</seg>
<seg id=14>Thank you!Dickens said, "This is the best time, this is the worst time."If you see Chiang Changjian, you can see that it is the worst of times, and that mobility is markedly reduced; if you look at my body, you can see that it is the best of times, and that mobility is very generous.I'm going to answer Chang-jian. Why Shanghai?To answer that question, we have to go back 170 years.It is a coincidence that, with the signing of the Nanjing Treaty in 1843, Shanghai was the second post of the five Chinese ports of commerce.Shanghai has entered a fast-growing path.This year has been 170 years since the opening of Shanghai.When Shanghai opened, the imperial powers began to arrive in Shanghai.The situation in Shanghai, of course, is different from that in later Hong Kong, where they established what they called the “tenancy line”.It has become a form of culture and a form of alien survival in Shanghai.It follows this 170-year-old development of the sea and is inextricably linked.Let us look back a little bit on the two stages of the development of this rental community.In the first phase, when foreigners came to Shanghai, what was their state of life?It's called "Separation of the Ocean."That's why Chinese and foreigners can't live together.However, by 1853 and 1855, a large number of Chinese refugees had begun to flood into the rental sector as a result of the Knife Intifada.So the form of survival of the rental community has been separated from the former ocean and transformed into a mosaic.It has since changed a historical change in Shanghai, showing three trends.The first is its very prosperous economy.The second is that there is a large number of western and central cultures on the edge of this rent, which begins slowly to merge.So it is because of this historical trend that the historical and cultural landscape of Shanghai as a whole has so many features, perhaps six words.The first one is called Newcomer.Because it accepts the rain and rain.Secondly, it can melt.Third, Shanghai is a commercial society, so it's a business.Fourth of all, it's unconventional.Shanghai culture in general is a civic culture.It's a very, very, very popular form of culture.So why did the people of the Kyoto tribe, represented by Shen, call the culture of Shanghai the culture of the sea?Today, when we speak of the culture of the sea, we may feel that this is a good idea.But that was a pejorative moment.So Shanghai culture is about this trend.So it is precisely because of this historical characteristic that the form of its management has become known as the “Nation of China”.It's an interesting thing to say, in this region, it's mostly foreigners, but they live in large numbers of Chinese, but the Chinese government has no control over it.So in this lease, it's turned into a very interesting grey area, and nobody cares about it.So in a region like this, you can find all kinds of people, all kinds of people.For example, you can find some former Qing's old man here, like Xu Hongji, who was the first, Jung Xiaojun.You can find the thuwar wanted by the Queen of Mercy, and here you can find the thugs and the typhoids reported by Su, who are shocked and shocked.Of course, Chen's "New Youth" was first born in Shanghai.It was only then that New Youth moved from Shanghai to Beijing because he was invited to Beijing to serve as head of literature at Beijing University.This led to the creation of the Five Four Campaigns, which led to the emergence of a new cultural movement.At the same time, our Communist Party, the First Congress of the Communist Party of China, is also in our Lu Bay region, in the French concession.The mayor is here today.Mayor Chow was the leader of the Lu Bay district.So you think it's a place in the legal community, so you can find a variety of political factions and political forces throughout the community.At the same time, it is beginning to show a dynamic trend in different areas of cultural thinking and artistic development.Liminger was just talking about this art.Uh, he's engaged in this book review.I'd like to say an example of a searing painting.All over the country, if you want to achieve something on this painting, or if you want to earn a lot of money, you have to come to Shanghai.The three giants who drew the sea pie, two of them were neither Shanghais, but only one, and the valleys were Shanghais.The other two, Wu Chang-seok, one from Lake County and the other from the mountains.What about Wu Chang-seok's late life? He's been living in Suzhou.He wanted to sell paintings in Shanghai, but he thought it was an adventurer's paradise, and he didn't want to go anywhere.So he sent one of his students, Zhao Yunchung, to Shanghai to explore the road.Then after a year, the U.S. cranes make a lot of money.So you can see his drawings in a lot of auction houses today.It's a rough painting, and it's a long way from the teacher.Uh, we can also see in the diary of Lake Wu's sail that this person's, uh, very low evaluation of this.But Oh Chang-seok saw his students paint so badly that he could make so much money in Shanghai.So he moved from Suzhou to Shanghai at the benevolent invitation of Wang Qing's company.So, without Shanghai, there are not as many famous artists as Oh Chang-seok, like Uncle Ren, like Zhang Daji and Liu Hai-hoon.Similarly, where do we always say the paintings of China originate?It's in Shanghai.Why did Shanghai have oil paintings?This is because a large number of foreign missionaries came to Shanghai after the opening of the port, and now you see the Catholic Church of Xu Jiaxuan.And this Catholic church, which was later known as the Tushan Bay Museum, is now more widely recognized as a cradle of Chinese paintings.Today you have heard that the Tuxshan Bay Museum is a very good name, and indeed it is an orphanage.In order for those orphaned, helpless orphans to grow up and return to society, they have their own skills, and the missionaries from all European countries use their art to cleanse their hearts, thus nurturing the kind of art that will make them able to survive in this society in the future.As we all know today, some of the painters who graduated from this school are popular painters, such as the famous sculptor, Mr. Zhang Chien.Mr. Zhang Khung In is also the only Chinese artist who has had a great resonance in Europe, because he and Tintin, the author of the euphemism, Ryan, are very good friends.Some even say that Tintin's image is a reference to this puncture.Mr. Zhang Khung-in is considered a master figure in France in his late years.He made the image of Midrand, and he made the image of this Debosi.He was therefore said to have had free access to the Aliseh Palace in Paris later in the year.Another teacher, Liu Hae-won, is called Zhou Shuu, so there is no Liu Hae-won without Zhou Yu.Without Liu, there would have been no such thing as the education of this Chinese painting.Liu Hae-won's Shanghai U.S. is the first Chinese to write in human form.At that time, it was inconceivable for a girl to be naked and painted by a group of men in a classroom.But it is because of Shanghai that it is able to have this open mind and a Heiner Bichuan mentality that Chinese paintings, especially the art of paintings, are well developed.I'm going to come back to Kyoto.In Beijing, we usually watch the Kyoto play, Shanghai people call it the play, Beijing people call it the play, because Beijing only listens.But when it moved to Shanghai, it became the so-called Hae-kyung show, not only better to hear but better to look good.Let me give one example, this artist, of course, is known as a representative character of the Kyoto play.But I can say that without Shanghai, without such a long river of his entire art, it can continue to this day to affect all those who love or like the Kyoto play.This man is called Melanfan.Melanfan first arrived in Shanghai in 1914, when he was 20 years old.At that time, when Merafán went to Shanghai, he was also an unnamed ordinary Danhorn actor.So when he was playing in Shanghai, he was hanging two cards.It's called the senior. It's called Wang Fengqing.You can see from the difference in the silver and silver that he was at the time that the barrier was so tight.This was 45 days for Wang Fengqing, 3,800 for 45 days, and Mr. May was just about 1400.Then, at Wang Fengqing's repeated request, he added $400, probably $1,800.By the time Melanfan returns to Shanghai for the second time, Melanfan will be the first, he'll have between 4,000 and 5,000 dollars, and Wang Fengqing will have lost about half as much as he used to be.So, the first performance in 1914, when Melanquin went to Shanghai, was very important to his life.First of all, he found the Shanghai stage very beautiful, the Beijing theatre, very dark, but he went to Shanghai to see the Shanghai stage, which was not big, but very bright.Because of what?There's a very bright stream of light bulbs on the counter, probably today called neon lights or LEDs.Ah, that's a rather new way. Well, he thinks it's very good.And for the first time, it was discovered that the Beijing stage in Shanghai was chasing after it.You see so much chasing light.The theater in Beijing is so dirty, it's nothing.Second of all, he thinks the actors on stage in Shanghai are more beautiful than the actors in the North.He started to study what he found, and the eyerings were different in makeup.The actors in Beijing are very light, so when you're on the stage, the actor's eyes are not big enough for God.As for the actor from Shanghai, it's usually very dark, it's very dark, it's very dark on the stage, it's very beautiful, it's very big, and it's very big.So, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, like, when, when, when, when, when, when, when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when, when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when you'?, you'?, you'?, you'?, you'?, youSecondly, we all know that the people who sing the Kyoto play have to post films.The actor in Beijing posted a four-dimensional picture, and the face was very short and not very nice.But he found out why the Shanghai actor's sticker was different from the North.Later Mr. May lived on this stage for 40 years, summing up four words called “before and after”.Shanghaiers are smart.You know, this different guy has a different face and his patches are different.If you're thinner, you have to put it back. It's bigger.This Chiang Chang building has to be put back.A fat face like mine has to go forward. I've got to go around here.What if this guy had a shorter face, he put it a little higher, a little shorter.What if it's the longer face, the lower one he put on.It's a great revelation to Merylvana.That is why Mr. May was later in May's art, and he was on the stage, in the kind of vinyl, and he was very generous, following Shanghai and learning from the Hirsch's Trinity actor.But these are all appearances.What's more important?More importantly, he learned that innovation in Shanghai, so it inspired and shocked Mr. May.Back in Beijing, Mr. May was with him, along with the members of the so-called Mae Party, and they had a lot of new plays, like "Silence," like "Tun Xia".So, in Mr. Melanfan's life, innovation became an important axis of his art.So, at the end of his life in his later years, he was the last play, and he became one of the most representative, uh, of the play called MacGui-Ying.It's from Henan's play, Mr. Markin Feng's transplant.So, I can say, without Shanghai, there is no later master of the Kyoto play, Melanfan.And today, on the streets of Shanghai, we are most impressed by the multitude of buildings on our outer beaches.There's one in so many buildings called art deco.This art has not survived in Europe for more than 20 years.Shanghai is the world's second largest construction after Czechoslovakia, atart deco.So why is it that a homeless man like Zhdak can find his place in Shanghai, which is the charm of Shanghai.The Shanghai movie, the Shanghai drama, the Shanghai popular song.So whether it's a literary drama or something like music or so, Shanghai will be such a big melting pot.It can be a focus of the world's attention, so it does not come out of thin air.In 170 years, Shanghai was transformed from a small coastal county town into a world-renowned phantom.And in this, we can look at the whole development of it.That is why the Times used to say in Shanghai that Shanghai was the pet of the times and a mixture of history.That is why in Shanghai there are so many coloured thoughts and so many coloured artists and arts.That is the title of my speech today, "Why Shanghai."Thank you!</seg>
<seg id=15>Good evening, everyone.Today I'm talking to you about a theme called "i-music, i-love, and i-think."The previous facilitator had already introduced the meaning of i.It means "internet" and "me".It was at a time when the social network revolution had broken out and all sectors of the world were affected.Indeed, everyone is inevitably faced with a choice.There is no choice, but we think we have a choice.The choice is whether to go in or to go back.So, in a limited life, we have very few choices to make.Many of the confusion, confusion, pain, sadness that we can avoid are also unlikely.What else can we do to help us besides self-empowerment?In fact, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God.Music is our real mind sticker.Music is our only life-saving straw.Music never asks what we want, but we can gain strength and confidence from it.To be comforted, comforted and loved for healing wounds.There are so many times when we may be awkward, and we cannot talk about it, but we can find in music a listener who best suits ourselves.Instead of listening to music, it's often listening to us.So I-music, I mean, I'm music, music is me.Every human being was born into this world as a natural musician.We already have a musical instrument that grows on our throats and is called vocals.Sing it up and make your throat not just talk, but sing it.Singing, giving our fineness, our breath, our God, a brand new face, gives us a very specific direction in every day's aspirations.Let all our pains and sorrows become elusive and even disappear, even temporarily.So let's see today, I've brought you some videos, and I've seen music on other people's bodies, how they're acting.Because of the timing, all of these videos can be found on the Internet without turning the wall.It's Apple's ad.It gives us the idea that Les is more, that simplicity is all.We're not really born to die without taking them away.A rich man once said, "There's no pockets on the shroud."We can't take anything, but we can stay in the world.What do you want to stay for?In fact, learning music is learning love.The process of learning music is learning how to love.So when our people, this society, this country, music is full of every corner and music can ring in every family's space, our differences of opinion are close and many of our quarrels are relatively avoided.Many of us have less sexual ills.Is music really that amazing?Yes.The end of our language is the beginning of music.In fact, before humans had a voice, there was already a prototype of sound music.Original humans communicate with each other by making their voices and comparing gestures. That's what we know now, six of them.So today I am, you know, not a violin from primary school, but I want to tell you, I-love in i-music.As long as there is love, everything can be a way to express a desire, to express a feeling, to express a love, to express a love.What am I showing you today?I'll play the violin for you on this ipad, which you may all know will be there.Let's see how I pull.Because there's a gyroscope in this computer of every tablet, and this gyroscope, based on its smoothness, produces this change in the tone.So it's a highly dynamic, sophisticated instrument, and it's not as stupid as a human being.There are 65 instruments, violins, cello, um, all kinds of things.So you're saying I'm pulling like that?Actually, is form important?Doesn't matter.The key is that you get to be happy.That's the key, right?Do not refuse to be happy, because it is not easy.It is an elite of so many who, through their creativity, work tirelessly and struggle.To bring happiness to us as a human being for every human being on Earth today.So don't reject happiness.Let this happiness go into your own heart and make you truly happy.How am I supposed to be happy?It's easier to be happy, I'm talking to a song.Listen, today we're here to listen, so I'm here to listen to it.Try to hear it.Listen, we come to listen.Happy, happy, happy for everyone.How's it going?Don't you think it's not your dream to turn your speech into a song at any time or place?When you meet a stranger, it's a little awkward, if you take this software out, uh, let's play a game, you say one thing, I say one thing.This love letter will be over soon.So don't be afraid of progress.These things make our boring, boring lives interesting.Let our seemingly long and bitter days be marked with sparks of fire.I'll tell you about these two software.The first software is called ThumbJam.Thumb means thumb.T-h-u-m-b-J-a-m.T-h-u-m-b-J-a-m is ThumbJam, a music studio that can be used by both professional and lay people.And this second software, the, uh, fun software, is talking into song called Songify.Song is s-o-n-g, then i-f-y.It's a word s-o-n-g-i-f-y, Songify.This software is made by an uh Stanford graduate and his girlfriend.And the two of them, uh, did this software from the beginning, and they did the same, actually a sound engine.They did it for 15 months, uh, with the company and they sold it to a listed company, and got, uh, $19 million.You think it's simple, yes, it's simple, but it's not simple.Often it's an idea, it's an idea, it's an idea that can change more than your own life, it can change the planet.I haven't played much myself in the last few years, but I've done a lot of work, a lot of work.I put the material from the Foley on the Western King's piano.Let's hear it. There's no Buddha here.</seg>
<seg id=16>It's just finished. I'm in the role of male number two for the television series Spring of the Office.A lot of people say Tang is still in a TV show just like you.Because they wanted to find an actor of their own character and become a president, they searched the Internet, called the “President of China's Top Ten Handsomes”.They don't know how to say it, but you know, what kind of people are there to vote for.What are you saying about 20 of us standing on the stage?Of course, Maun had a classic saying that he said, "The wisdom and looks of men are usually inversely proportional."I think that's too good for him. You know what I mean?Because he's one of the most intelligent men I think around us.I'm actually here today to share some of my life's thoughts with you.What's life?Actually, life is a journey.If it is a journey, there will be an end, and it is interesting that we all end up with the same end, and you choose it, and you do not choose it, and we all get that end.When you reach the end, the great thing is to hang on to the wall.In China, the number of places on the wall is limited and the number of places has been occupied.So, I think when you think about this, you really don't have to go after it, and you can't go around it.So what's the most important thing in life?I think it's the process.Since it is the course of life, we say there is laughter, there is tears and, of course, there is rain.The book says, "A person's life without a storm is incomplete."I think I must be much more complete in this sense than every one of you.Meaning you understand.We looked at the whole time, and I turned it back 24 years ago in 1990, when Tang Yong was a graduate student at Nagoya University, Japan, who was studying for his degree.You see, I'm trying to keep my Ph.D. out here for a little bit of a low profile.At a regular research event, my mentor, Mr. Ishikura, was very unhappy with me, and finally he used the phrase, "It may be impossible in Japan to take back your Chinese work and turn it into a paper."Think about the feeling of a weak me, the kind of pricking of a heart.I can't stand it anymore. I'm angry. I lost the information in my hand on the table.You know, it gave me a choice, or a choice I had to make.What's the choice?I chose to stand against my mentor; I chose what I had to leave Japan; and I chose what I had chosen, and I chose the degree that I had been working hard for five years and six months to get.A lot of people would ask me if Tang Ping regretted you? That fall, that choice was not regretful.I didn't regret it, not because my choice led me into Microsoft and made me today.It wasn't like that. 20 years later, I was told I was one of his best students, not that. The headmaster of Nagoya University told me that I was an outstanding alumni of Nagoya University.I think that that was the choice that gave me a little bit of dignity and a little bit of bones in front of them.To make up for such a gap, I've read a so-called nine-time graduate student in the United States.Twenty years later, a huge web wave was created in China.A lot of people criticize me, criticize me.A lot of people would say, "Do you feel depressed?"What's that supposed to be?It's an anger, it's a defeat.What's depressing?Before spring, I saw a relative's kid smoking in the toilet, and I said you smoke in junior high school.He replied, "The fishing island problem has not been solved, and he's in a bad mood."It's a depressing feeling, and what's my name?Time continues to flow back and forth 12 years ago today, when I was president of Microsoft China.At that time, the Internet might have just begun.What is the most used application on the Internet?It's called a chat application.At the time, Microsoft, there was a chat tool called MSN, whose market share was far ahead of having such a dick in China as QQ.But I found that the QQ user growth was much higher than that of Microsoft MSN.And I found that there's only one function that Microsoft MSN doesn't have.What function?Talking to strangers is such a function, you know.And I said to Gates, and I said, "If we don't add this function to Microsoft, we're gonna lose it."Gates said, "Why do you Chinese like to talk to strangers?"I said, "That's a human need!"He said, "It must be the needs of Chinese men."Think, a man talking to a strange man on the Internet all day. How much mental qualities do you need?“No, it's the needs of both sides.”Finally, Gates accepted my idea of adding this function to the Chinese market alone, with one condition.He said that Microsoft China would commit itself to the next three years to obtain $1.5 million in advertising on MSN to cover the cost of development and maintenance.I have a choice ahead of me, but I have no choice.Why isn't there a choice?Because I don't dare choose.Why not?Because I care too much about Microsoft's job, and I give up.What's the result of giving up?We all know that MSN officially withdrew from the stage of history last year.I was thinking that if I had chosen that time, there might have been a big change in the pattern of the Internet in China; if I had, I would have preferred the Bolmer, maybe I wouldn't have had to.So we say that the great thing about life is that it's constantly choosing because you don't know the results.You've been through so much, what's your biggest feeling.I feel like I'm making a choice.It was also asked how your life came to you when you were in the most difficult of times, when you were in a state of frustration.What I'd like to share with you is that I have a so-called Down Bottom Line resistance.Let's call it a bottom line counter-pressure.What do you mean, bottom line?I'm just trying to figure out all the worst, and when you think about it, if there's one of the worst.What are you going to do?Can you stand such an outcome?When we all knew the Internet waves a few years ago, I was thinking, what was the worst outcome for me, and the worst result must be that my wife left me.A lot of people say you're still thinking about women at this point in time.Being a man, it's harder to be a good man.But what I'm thinking is, because half of men's happiness comes from women.But did you think that all women's happiness came from men?I was relieved to think about it.That's one of the ways I've chosen in my past life to be called bottom line counter-pressure.Many of us here today have chosen to listen, and you do not need courage.But at the end of the day, I'd like to say to those who came here to listen to my address, that you're really good.Thank you!</seg>
<seg id=17>I'm a lawyer.A friend asked me the other day, "What's the most important thing that you've been working for over a decade?"Looking back carefully, it was not really those cases in which hundreds of millions of dollars had been marked, nor those in which the Supreme People's Court had been sitting.Can you imagine that?It's a case of $475.83 cents.In 2005, I entered the industry a few years ago and took over a small case.My client's from out of town.We rented a living house in our city.He subsequently had to check out early because of the mobility problem.In other words, the landlord needs to be asked in advance to cancel the lease.Well, it wasn't a big deal.My client has a deposit at the landlord's place, and the two sides are taking care of it.The deduction shall be reduced.Finally, the landlord should return my client $475.83 cents.There's nothing to talk about.At that time, however, the landlord was obsessed with refusing to return the $475.I guess the landlord was thinking, you're a stranger, you're no big deal, you can't take more than $400.My client wouldn't have eaten this dumb loss.The case was brought before the court by a direct attorney and he was brought before the court on a petition.It's funny to say. Is there any need for a lawsuit on such a simple matter?But what you can't imagine is that this landlord is using a local relationship.The first instance ruled that he did not have to refund the $475.Don't tell me what my client feels like.It's a blow to my newly-applied lawyer.I have a direct influence on my judgment about the values of life.In any case, an appeal is to be filed.In the court of second instance, the final judgement was rendered after our due process, multiplicity of evidence, four rounds of negotiations and eight rounds of negotiations.Finally asked him to refund the money.But can you imagine, it's not that simple.This small case is in the implementation phase.The implementation process is not complicated.The judge called the parties and me to the office and, in front of everyone, asked the landlord to bring out $475 in cash and to give it to my client.But just the moment we left, something unexpected happened.On his way out, the landlord pointed his finger at my nose and said, "Ingent Ken, two shoulders carrying a head, we'll see."At that moment, my mind was coming to a halt.As for that, it's $475.Anyway, I snuck out the back door of the court that day.It's a good thing we haven't met this brother in years.I guess he's not on the scene today, or else it's really troublesome.It's not so simple to think about it now.Why would anyone want to break the rules of our society for $475? Would they want to break the rules of a simple tenancy contract?Are we born with such impulses?China has been reforming and opening up for more than three decades, and the establishment of the rule of law has indeed been marked by progress and development.But there are often social phenomena that we see.I, for my part, now serve a lot of corporate clients.I find that when the bosses often encounter problems and disputes, the first thing that comes to mind is the mayor, the director and the director.Because of my work relationship, I often go with my friends to see them for a long time.One day, I accompanied a friend of mine to visit the president of our local Intermediate People's Court.In the chatting process, I found out that the director, who was close to the age of 50, was not familiar with many of the rules in force and was accustomed to judging things by experience.So, I'm going to print out a copy of the existing regulations on something and hand it over quietly to this president.I didn't think the Dean would look at this thing and say to me, "What is it? It's not up to our brothers."Wow, at that time you really knew what Simon was talking about.Why?Why do we now, law enforcers, rulers, often ignore the rules for their existence?Why do they often use the rules system as a tool and a play for themselves?Why is there no sense of respect and respect for the rules in their hearts?Is this what George W. Bush says, "The power is not in a cage"?In the present society, there are a lot of strange social phenomena.That is what we have just said about those who have power as rulers, and is it not true that, as an ordinary, powerless general public like us, there will be no violations of the rules?You won't cross the mine?About 10 years ago, there was a strange case in the northeast.There was a school that organized group trips for teachers during summer holidays.When the bus service arrived at a rest area on the national road, an armed robber came from under the car.This little robber doesn't look too old, he looks 14 or 5, but the knife in his hand scares everyone.As a result, the robbers looted everyone's belongings from the rear to the head of the vehicle.Just as the robbers arrived, they saw a young and beautiful teacher sitting at the door with a golden necklace on his neck.With all due respect, the robber reached out and grabbed the necklace around his neck.The teacher, who thought the robber was coming and sexually assaulted herself, began to resist instinctively.The girls' clothes were torn apart by both sides during the scavenging process.In a hurry, the female teacher took a bunch of books from her hand and threw them at the robbers.That's a terrible blow. I knocked a little robber out of his head.At that time, all of the 20 teachers in the car rose up and punched and kicked the little robbers who had lost their resistance.By the time the robber was finally handed over to the public, almost half of his life had been lost.Why?We found that at that time, the 20 or so people called “teachers” had completely ignored the existence of the rules.At that moment, these two dozen people released the magic of their hearts, and they had forgotten the existence of a system of social rules.Even forgetting that even the robbers have the right to be tried.Is there no such sense of piety and respect for the rules in the minds of our nation?I guess, no.We recall the intellectual and cultural history of the Chinese nation for more than 2,000 years.During the war in Spring and Fall, more than 2,500 years ago, our Chinese society had at the same time the birth of such important ideas as a Confucian, a Taoist, a Frenchman, a Murdoch and others.But what I am trying to say today is that the current sociology is prevalent, but it is never the same as Confucianism.Let's talk about the Murphys today.It speaks of understanding and reverence of the rule system, which belongs to the Ink family.The Ink family is a very disciplined group, known by its leaders as the giants.During the war country of about 400 A.D., the fourth generation of the giants lived in Qin and their son killed.In accordance with the law, they shall be executed.But the then King of Qin Hye felt that he was too old to kill a son.But the stomach says, “The law of the Ink family states that `the death of the murderer, the death penalty for the wounded' is a necessary means of prohibiting the killing of the person, which is in the best interest of the world”.So he decided to kill his son.This story is a vivid illustration of the understanding of the rules system among the Indo family, which has reached a level of piety and even what can be called faith.Isn't that the spirit that we now need in a society governed by the rule of law?Isn't it even what we need to run a Chinese business now?But how did you get that spirit?At this point in time, I think it is necessary to look at the core of the ink's thinking.For more than 2,000 years, the heart of Moji thought has always been the word of love.The idea of “along love” emphasizes that love between brothers and sisters of the subjects is based on equality.In the light of this simple concept of equality, a sense of respect and respect for the rule-of-law system, as we now call it, has been created in the family.As we can see, the philosophy of “compassion” gives rise to a social concept of equality, which creates the social environment of the rule of law.Unfortunately, however, this important idea has not become the mainstream of society in the future.During China's West Han period, about 2,000 years ago, a husband named Dong Jong-suk and his master, Han Wu Emperor, jointly launched a policy of “destroying hundreds of families and exclusives”.Under this policy, society is guided by the notion of the feudal hierarchy of kings, subjects, fathers and sons.As a result, there is no equality in society, and society is no longer in a position to do so.That perception continues to this day and remains in today's Chinese society.We can see that some people violate the rules of society and even the law, but instead receive a special treatment, including special areas of supervision, because of their particular background and status.Some people, owing to the background of the official family, were treated in a special way when travelling, including driving out of police cars and entering the scenery area.Some people have special status.A girlfriend has to go to a hotel to open a room, including being filmed by surveillance cameras.What we need more in our society is the concept of the rule of law, which is free and equal, but which is not easy to come by.Fortunately, the advent of the Internet era has given us a glimmer of hope and light.We have found that in an Internet society, we can de-identify and de-centralize equal communication.In an Internet society, people have created a community based on simple, simple and useful rules.In communities with this concept of equality, we can communicate on an equal footing.I am confident that the social system and the tide of society will contribute to the creation of a society in which all of us look for the rule of law that is equal and free.Thank you.</seg>
<seg id=18>We just talked about the application of 100 degrees of translation and how to use 100 degrees of API, so what's the technology behind that translation that you might be interested in?Now let's talk about the technology behind the 100-degree translation.In fact, we have to mention that in 1946, the first computer in the world was born.Because it's only when the computer has it that we can use it for translation.In fact, there was a genius scientist who was wondering if we could use computers for translation.In 1947, American scientists published a memorandum of translation that mentioned whether we could use computers for translation.In practice, then, machine translation is a cross-disciplinary subject that requires the use not only of computer knowledge, but also of informatics, cognitive sciences, linguistics, etc.So it's been almost 70 years from 47 to now, and a lot of machine-translations have emerged in those 70 years.For example, in the beginning, rules-based machine translation, so-called rules-based translation, is that we get some human linguists to sum up language phenomena, write language rules, put them in computers, become computer-friendly languages, and translate.It is clear from this approach that if we do multilingual translations, we need different linguists to write, so development costs are very high and later less used.By the 1980s, evidence-based methods of translation had emerged.The so-called example-based method of translation is to say that when we learn a language, we may not care very much about what syntax is in it.So we're going to read a lot of readings to get a sense of the word, to express habits and phrases, and naturally there's such a physical model to create such a translation.For example, there's a sentence that says, "Please get me a glass of water," so there's a corresponding English translation.So if we're going to translate another sentence, "Please get me a pen," then as long as we replace the water with a pen and the corresponding English-language Uh Water with a pen, it's also relevant, so it's one of the main ideas for machine translation based on examples.After the 1990s, IBM scientists came up with the idea of statistical machine translation, which has been, uh, a mainstream method of translation so far.The so-called statistical machine translation is that we use a large amount of bilingual data to build a translation model, and then, by abstraction, we create a mathematical model that establishes a relationship between the language of origin and the language of the target.Then, especially with the integration of the Internet, the translation of statistical machines has taken on great power.This mainstream research trend continued until 2014.The neural network machine translation method was introduced in 2014, which is the hotspot of a study to date, and there has been a significant improvement in the quality of translation as compared to that of a statistical machine.What needs to be mentioned here is the rule-based era, where, uh, rules-based commercial translation software emerged in the mid- and late 1970s.There was then a statistically based Internet translation system around 2006.This represents a translation software for two different periods.Then, by 2014, reference had just been made to the introduction of a neural network machine translation, which was a product of a laboratory, and there was still a long way to go if it were applied to industry.In the case of statistical machine translation, for example, it was proposed around 1991, but the real large-scale Internet-based translation system went through 15 years in 2006.How long has it been since 14 years since the neural network machine was translated from the lab to the industry?In less than a year, then 100 percent of the world's first neural network translation system.Subsequently, in September 2016, companies such as Google launched their own neural network translation system.Since the advent of the Internet, it has been mentioned that there is a large amount of available data on the Internet.One of the big data that has been mentioned by many now, for example, is that we can tap hundreds of billions of pages of translated material from the Internet, as well as some authoritative dictionaries at the scale of tens of millions.At the same time, a number of web-based verbs, popular language are emerging on the Internet, which need to be updated in a timely manner.These three, uh, are bilingual materials, one is an authoritative dictionary, and there are some web-based verbs, popular languages, which make up our main, uh, training data for a translator.On that basis, we obtained a high-quality knowledge base for translation through some tests to remove noise and new words.The translation needs of the Internet are, in fact, diverse: we have the translation needs of poetry, the translation of papers, the translation of news, the need for patents, the need for chatting, etc.It is clear that one translation system or model alone will not solve the problem, so 100 per cent translation is actually a multi-strategy translation system.For example, we have both a rules-based approach and an example-based approach, as well as a statistical approach, and a neurological network-based translation method, which is now popular.These methods of translation complement each other, take advantage of each other's strengths, respond to different translation needs and ultimately produce high-quality translation results.Let me now briefly describe the advantages of these approaches separately.Statistical machine translation, for example, was mentioned earlier as being based on extensive bilingual data training.For example, in the top two frames, the left is a bilingual figure, the first is in Chinese, the second is in English, and we use the example of the Han-young to describe the translation of statistical machines, so it corresponds to one sentence to the other.On the right is simple English, we call it monolingual data, on the left we call bilingual parallel data.With some statistical analysis, we can create a translation model from the data on the left, for example, that my blue and red words can match.Well, it's a phrase like, "I'm going to tell," so English is I will tell, "you" can be translated into you, which can be done automatically.In other words, with this bilingual text, we can build relations between the source and the target languages, so the translation model is more like a bridge.So this one on the right is a language model that measures a fluidity of the target language after its creation.We can say, for example, "I am a student," which is a good expression, consistent with English.But if you say "I is a student", it's a grammatical error.The language model can tell that “I am a model” is more fluid than “I is a model”, and the former score is higher.So through the translation model, it builds a bridge and a language model, it measures the flow of the target language, and we can translate it.For example, I have a new sentence here: “I want to tell you a story”, which has never appeared in our training data, but we've seen these pieces.For example, I will tell, you can be translated into "you", a translation into "a" and the story corresponds to "story," so we can get a English translation of "I will tell you a story" through a combination.But in the actual, uh, application scene, there are actually more complex strategies than this one.For example, in Chinese, the order of sentences is usually not the same as in English, and there is a process of sequencing.Also in the translation of statistical machines, we have just said that it is based on a large amount of training materials, such as Chinese and English, and we have a great deal of training data.There are, however, a few very small minority languages, such as Chinese and Thai, Chinese and Japanese, Chinese and Korean, whose bilingual data are not very large or even very scarce.So what do we do at this point in time? Do we still have to use the statistical machine for translation?The answer is also yes.We have proposed a method of translation based on pivotal languages, the so-called pivotal languages, which we are, in general terms, introducing a third language as a bridge.For example, we have a great deal of bilingual data in Chinese and English, as well as bilingual data in English and Thai, and we can each build a Chinese-English translation model and an English-Thai translation model.This medium is used as a bridge between English and, by some modeling, we can build a translation model for Chinese and Thai, and thus also achieve a translation system for Chinese and Thai.So, with such a technology, we can rapidly expand the translation from two languages, Chinese and English, to 28 languages and more.The rule-based approach is briefly described below.What's its strength?It's that we can easily come up with something regular so that we can apply it to the translation system.Here are two examples.In the first sentence, for example, my blue font is a date: 28 September 2015.In Chinese, we usually say "day" and "day" in some Western countries, so we can adjust the chronology of Chinese to that of English.The following example shows the translation of a number, for example 380, so we can easily write some rules on how to translate it into the right English.So this is one of the advantages of a rule-based approach.A case-by-case approach is presented below, where the translation that is usually good at it is a number of new words, proverbs, non-hot words and customary expressions.It's usually something that we can't say a word for translation, and it's usually a translation of meaning.For example, it's a more popular sentence of the previous two years, "Do not die," so how do you flip it?It's obviously hard to flip.Then someone summed up a method of translation, which, of course, was also recorded in a city dictionary in the United States.It's hard to do with any kind of translation.So let's put it in our training data.If we find such a sentence, we'll simply translate it and, uh, show it to the user.This is an example-based approach where the application should be humbly applied.Finally, a neural network machine translator that has emerged in the last two years.As in the case of statistical machine translations, you can see that the source language is actually cut into different segments, such as “I want to tell” and “you” and so on.As I mentioned earlier, when these segments are combined into translations, there will be some reordering of the sequence, as well as some cases where the context is not, uh, visible.So in the neural network machine translation, it doesn't have these problems, it first encodes the source language as a whole, through the layers of the neural network and the abstractly final output of the translation.It's like when people look at it in the translation process, we translate a sentence, usually read it first, get the whole message of the sentence and then translate it.This allows us to make full use of the context of the sentence and the overall information, with the resulting translations being more complete and in order more in line with the order of expression in the target language.So it's the neural network machine that translates it.As I mentioned earlier, the neural network machine translation was actually just introduced in the laboratory in 2014.After less than a year, on May 20th, 2015 and May 20th, it was a very good day, 520, that we launched the world's first Internet neural network machine translation system, called NMT, N means Neural, which opened a translation scene for large-scale NMT applications and opened a new chapter for large-scale NMT applications.Well, as you know, in September 2016, Google also released its own NMT system.Well, from September 2016 to the present, machine translation based on the neural network has been a research hot spot and an application of, uh, a hot spot.In practice, however, we often encounter some difficulties when referring to a study from a laboratory to an industrial application.For example, in the case of machine-statistical translation, when it was just introduced in 91, everyone was limited to the language, machine, model, realization, etc.Only in 2006, after 15 years, did the world's first Internet-based system of methodological translation become available.So, after the neural network translation method was presented, we studied it in depth in terms of efficiency, data, models, etc., and proposed a series of improvements that could be quickly applied to our translation.So here's a simple list of us that we've come up with some very effective and innovative ways to do this.These methods are published at our highest international conferences in this field like ACL, Triple AI, etc.If you're interested, you can take a look.Here, I will simply use one of these as an example to introduce you.This is the NMT system that we introduced in 2015 based on multitasking learning, which addresses a problem, as well as the translation of a small language that has just been mentioned.For example, we have a large amount of data in Chinese and English, but we have very few data in Central Thailand, China and Japan, and China and Korea.So can we come up with a way, because the Chinese are all connected, and we're all sharing an encoder at the Chinese end, and we're using different decoders at different target ends.At the end of Chinese, at the end of source language, we all share an encoder.At the end of the target language, each target language corresponds to one of its own decoder, thus creating a multiplicity of translations.We can translate Chinese into English, Korean, Thai, Japanese, etc. at the same time.So the work was later evaluated by the New York Times as a Pathbreaking paper, a landmark article that was widely cited and used.In the same vein, in 2015 we also introduced a number of mobile-end translations, i.e., cellular-ends.So, for example, when you travel, you often encounter a lack of access to the Internet or too much money, and if you download our offline packages, you can also use our NMT system to obtain high-quality translation services.So at the end of the cell phone, the storage and computational resources of the cell phone, we need to do some extra work to make this model work.For example, we first compressed this model 70 times, so it only needs 30 megagrams of memory to run smoothly at the end of the cell phone.Ah, we have some dynamic-loaded algorithms, and so on.With some of these optimizations, we can easily access our NMT system on the cellular end and now support the Chinese, English, Japanese and Korean languages.The technology of 100-degree translation was widely recognized by expert scholars, for example in 2014 by the Chinese Electronics Institute's first prize for scientific and technological progress, and in 2015 by the State's second prize for scientific and technological progress.The list below is a list of our scholarly papers that you can search online and download if you are interested.Thank you.</seg>
<seg id=19>I was called the previous two days by a fellow male student, who asked me, Tetsu, that you were going to speak on the 29th, "Boy is a loser."Do you think we girls would try so hard to save a boy if he was a loser and his life was short?This phone has a background.Last year our class had a thematic session to save the boys.Our school is also a good Shanghai school, and our class is the best class in the year, but we often find these phenomena.For example, in class activities, girls are included in the books; the script is always written by girls; the cleaning of classes lasts for girls; boys are long gone.Even girls are often better off than girls.So, all the girls and teachers are worried and asking where our good boys are?As a result, the "Save the Boys" workshop will be successfully launched.Every boy seems to be under a lot of pressure to speak out and talk about how he should become a good boy and about his intentions for the future.They even invited my father to speak to you as a successful man.Of course, I don't think he's a very successful man.Well, I hope he's a successful man who can set an example and inspire boys.We girls, on the other hand, are an introspection, and speaking of ancient times, it can be said that the whole class brings together our girls' high expectations and care for boys.After that, our girls and teachers agreed that the class would be a great success.Later on, we held events such as the ten best boys for the female vote, where girls voted for the good boys, and how it inspired the boys.I hear time is the best way to test emotional input.As a matter of fact, today, a year later, our girls are still struggling to do the pt.Last August, I attended the Gobi bar mitzvah.In that sunny season, together with nearly 70 teenagers from all over the country, I set foot on the wall and on the most difficult road to find.Four days to complete 88 km.After all, he was a class leader for several years, after an intense rescue operation for boys, so I was prepared to become a Gobi woman long before Gobi went up.When I got to the Gobi, I found that there were far more boys on the team than girls and that none of the captains, flagmen, etc. were boys, and I started to worry about my team.Our team has a nickname "Lightie", he's one of the thintest boys on the team, and he's one of our pioneers.Once, we got a little lost, and we didn't know how to get there.That's when he offered to say, "Let me take a look."You know, in a place like Gobi, if you really get lost, it's not a joke.But he's on his way.We were really excited when he was small again next to a rock.When they send us a warning and take us back to the right path.I am deeply moved by his dedication to the team and his courage.The other is our captain.Our team was unique, and it was not on the basis of speeches, but on the basis of fair play.It's about brushing our faces, that is, we've chosen one of the smoothest and oldest men to be captains.He's a friend of ours. He's actually a better talker.The captain's job was largely to finish, so he said he had to walk at the end of the line every day and never felt the joy and pride of the first line.In addition, he assisted the team leader in caring for the wounded and reminded the team members to rehydrate the water in a timely manner.Act as a walkie-talkie, as a charger, as a mobile medicine kit, etc.Work is very cumbersome and tired, but we have never read complaints on his sturdy face.There's a lot of stories about boys on the Gobi.At that time, they really became the manhood that we girls expected.That's when we girls played Gobi roses, and it was the best time for Gobi roses, because they didn't have long thorns.To say a word like a role, a role simply means what a person thinks of himself and what a pattern of behaviour has been adopted.The Gobi, the independent, the man, the girl needs to be protected, and even the boy who has just set foot on the Gobi can easily turn into a man.That's the charisma of the role, it can change a person's behavior.But there's another problem here. Why can the tights and captains act better in these men?And there's a word called role positioning, an irreplaceable position, that's role positioning.On the Gobi, in our ranks, the role played by the tights is not just that of a man, but also that of our vanguard, who is the only one.This unique role is his role positioning.And so is our captain.The role to be played by Ling is that of a captain, so much can only be done by him.It's unique and irreplaceable, and that's role-setting.Because of the irreplaceable role orientation, we can turn excellence into excellence.Remember when my real long-term career started in sixth grade.At that time, the captain was asked to write a class ending every week and then take it to the podium on Monday.I'll never forget the first time in sixth grade I took that light class to the podium.It's like he's got a rabbit in his head.But I cried to myself in my heart, and you were the captain and the captain.After a week of shouting like that, I'm not nervous anymore.I was faced with a lot of work at a time when I was up at a later grade, when my workload increased and my classes were completed every day, often late in the night.Look at all the basic questions in it, and sometimes they're taken away.I hear women tend to stay up all night and get older.I don't want to get old so early.But whenever my eyes turn to the answer, there's always a voice in my heart. You're a class leader and a class leader.How can I apologize to Sergeant?So I accepted frankly the fact that I seemed older than others.I didn't know the concept of role positioning at the time, but now I think it's really the charm of role positioning.It enables a person to walk on his path without remorse and without fear of any hardship.Do boys really need to be saved?In my opinion, it would suffice if we told them that you were a man, a pioneer and a captain.</seg>
<seg id=20>Hello, everyone!Uh, it is a great pleasure today to have the opportunity to share with you the theme of beauty and science.Not pretty science. Of course we're talking about pretty girls.The aesthetics that can't be applied to beautiful women are hypocritical, so we need to get this right.So what I'm saying today is to share two parts: the first is the science of the beauty, the science of the beauty; the second is the beauty of the science, the beauty of the science.The 25th of November was the most beautiful day for me.Why is it beautiful?Two reasons.One reason is that Einstein published a broad theory of relativity 100 years ago on this day, so it is the most beautiful scientific theory for me.Another reason you can see is that the most beautiful girl in the world was born 25 years ago, my daughter.What's the commonality between the beauty of my daughter and the beauty of general relativity?What's the science in this?This is what I want to share with you today.In other words, we ask one question: what is beauty?So the question has actually been asked by philosophers for more than 2,000 years, starting with the great philosopher Socrates to his student Plato, and by his student Aristotle, to the present philosophers Kandeh, Hegel and so on.This question is referred to as the follow-up of geniuses.So let's see what the philosophers are asking for for more than 2,000 years now.Then, of course, there are very many kinds of answers.We have chosen the alumni's views on this issue, as summarized by Professor Julien of the University of Tanya.Professor Chu said that I didn't think I could answer that question, but Plato said that beauty is difficult, so beauty is difficult.And Professor Chu goes on to say that I think it's a very good word.Beauty is what, beauty is hard.I'd say beauty is a woman.If we're in class, then when I was speaking, I, uh, when I was speaking, for example, with Anne today, asked me questions and asked me, "Dear Professor, how high is the sun?"Then I teach astronomy, and that's the right question.And I said, "Dear classmate, how true am I?"And then, "How many stars are there in the sky?"And I went on to say, "There's a lot of N-N-N."You may recall that we had a beautiful woman, Yang Xiao, who sings a very similar song.So if I answer the same question in the same way, I'm sure Ann's going out there crying in the bathroom.So that's the typical answer.It seems to me that the answer to beauty is difficult and a little more like that.So, what's beauty?Beautiful is difficult.As far as you're concerned, I don't believe it.Why?Because it's not science.Why not science?The answer is not our custom.At the bottom of the question is the natural role of scientists, and we would like to answer that question.So how am I supposed to think about this?Actually, I've been thinking about it for almost 30 years.I need a natural science approach to aesthetics.We have a famous physicist, Mr. Peng Qingwu, who said, “The material world, though changing, is very sincere, and `the same phenomenon is inevitable under the same conditions'”.So I'm going to apply Mr. Peng's words to aesthetic research.I would like to say that the beauty of the world, while constantly changing, and the variety of beautiful women present are very different, should have an inherent pattern.So, if I actually do it, I'll start with the problem.Mr. Einstein taught us that it is not only Einstein who taught us general relativity, but also scientific research methods.He said that it was more important to ask a good question than to solve an N problem.What's beautiful?I think there's a different way to say that.My formulation is to say, in a broad sense, that aesthetic objects can include beauty, which may include beauty, which may include food, or fine art, which art, which science which may include beauty, what standards do they meet?In other words, what are the criteria for judgment in the broad sense of beauty?I turned this into a problem.In other words, if the criteria for judgment in the broad sense of beauty are established, we can understand “what is beauty” or “what is beauty”.Of course, the broad beauty criterion is academic, and I call it the broad beauty rule, so I am trying to build a broad beauty rule.What about the specifics?I am a three-part approach that follows our comparative standards for natural science research.If we look at steps, we are, in particular, a three-part approach.First of all, we need to sum up.We need to bring out the different types of beauty according to what we do, and we want to sum up the rule that commonality is beautiful.Then we have to prove it.That is to say, to give more examples and to try to find out, as much as possible, whether what we think is beautiful is contrary to our rules.If not, we will change that rule in violation of that rule.Then we have to testify.We need to find out what we feel is not in keeping with that rule in order to do the opposite.In that case, I finally got the law of broad beauty.This broad rule of beauty is “no flaws, not common.”If we meet both conditions, we'll feel beautiful.“There are no flaws” for values.For example, they are powerful, natural, reasonable, complete, true and good.It's common, of course, to say something different, different, excellent, air, etc., but it's also very common to say that it's natural, urban, imitating, bouncing, etc.The man in this room, if you put any of my "common" entries on your girlfriend or your wife, I promise she'll strangle you if she doesn't kill you.So beautiful judgment is in this place.What's a aesthetic?Why do we have different aesthetics?The aesthetics are the ability to judge beauty, the values to judge whether there are flaws, and then our insights to judge whether they are not common.So different values, coupled with our different perspectives, lead us to different aesthetics.It's beautiful for the same thing, for object, for man, for anyone who thinks that there are no defects and no one who is not.When you feel like there's nothing wrong with it, you feel beautiful.Since when do you think it's common for you to think it's not beautiful?So there is no objective beauty, no absolute beauty, no universal beauty, no eternal beauty.Beauty is always changing.Let me give you one example below.This is one of the things I put in my circle of friends yesterday.We know that the weather in Beijing was good the other day.All of us put blue clouds in the circle of our friends.I posted the morning Xia and the clouds yesterday.And I said, "It's still hot, it's hot, it's blue, it's white, but why doesn't anyone say it's beautiful today?"Because the clouds have been blue and white for some time now, and although there are no flaws, they are no longer uncommon, so they don't look beautiful.So I said, "O mist, gently tell me when you'll end your vacation."I asked such a question.Then there was a comment, and a friend said, “If a scientific philosopher sees this, it must be high enough to say that scientists come to sacrifice everyone's health in order to prove his aesthetic theory”.I quickly replied that I said it wasn't like that.I replied that I would rather have the common blue sky and no health defects than the common ones.Then a friend went on to comment that this comment was even worse.He said, "How's the weather today?"So that's what happens when you don't make friends.One more example.This is Mr. Ho, my mentor.And the beauty of the autumn of the Qinghua Garden, and I say it is also the beauty of beauty.I put this in my circle of friends on November 22nd.Two events took place on 22 November.One thing was a commemorative meeting at Qinghua University to mark the 69th anniversary of the important research work of my mentor, Mr. He Zehui.But Mr. Ho died a few years ago.Let's see what's in this picture. This little girl on the left is a pretty girl.It's a picture of Mr. Ho when he was young.Apparently a little beauty.On the right is a picture of my mentor, Mr. Ho, in his late years.It's still glowing.That is why I say that Mr. Ho is a man of high intelligence, high colour and high moral character.Such a beautiful woman is the most beautiful.It's the same Qinghua Garden. It's the good one. It's the good one. It's the good one.And, of course, there's always a better natural environment for autumn.The snow scenes are also good, and the first snowmills of each year are good.On November 20, there was a snowfall in Beijing.But these two things, taken together, are, of course, still without flaws.But more importantly, it is not common.Autumn snow scenes are not common together.The snow melts early and leaves behind the snowfall, which is too late for the fall.Autumn snow scenes together are the most beautiful.Because there are no flaws, not the usual extremes.So on November 20, everyone posted photos in their circle of friends online.That's why.And it's very rare to have three tall girls, so it's beautiful.I give the example that there are no flaws, and it's not usually the most beautiful.Here's the beauty of science.The science of beauty is clear.Here's the beauty of science.Scientific exploration, we know, is full of surprises.Accidents are, of course, the biggest unusual.So I do astronomy myself.I use astronomy as an example.We know that most of the ground-breaking astronomy research is unexpected.I counted it.The Institute of Astronomy received about a dozen Nobel Prizes in Physics, only one of which was the result of the plan, the Nobel Prize, and all of which were unexpected and intended to be unexpected.Of course, time is limited to just one example, and while I have listed so many, I have only one.Ah, this has something to do with pretty girls.That's where Ms. Bell found Radio Pulse Star in 1967.Let's take a look at this pretty girl. She's a photo of her research, post-graduate.All she had to do was study interstellar scintillation, which was known at the time.However, she accidentally discovered the radio pulsar, which was the cyclical arrival of the radio transmission.And this one on the right was last summer when I met Professor Bell at a meeting in Hawaii last summer.I knew her before.We talked together.We see that Professor Bell is still a shining man.So it's also a 3-year-old woman of high color, IQ, and high moral character.The three-highest girls in this class are all my goddesses.Let me show you a few more pictures, uh, of what we think is a beautiful view.The one on the left is a picture of the living, a photograph of a nuclear plate of spores.And this one in the middle is a picture of our finger piercing a soap bubble.On the right is a picture of a galaxy.These pictures are not as beautiful as they are.Why is it beautiful?It's natural, so there's no defects, so it's not common for the naked eye to see.It happens all the time, but our eyes don't see it, so when we see it, we say it's beautiful.Again, this is an issue.The same is true of scientific photos.Here's the general relativity of Einstein.We know that I just spoke of 25 November, a hundred years ago, when Einstein published the most beautiful scientific theory of general relativity.Broad relativity is, of course, based on Newton mechanics, which we know he published in 19 1687.This theory actually seems very simple today.He raised Galileo's inertia to the first and second laws of Newton, plus the third law of Newton, which was the original Newton, and the law of gravity, which was the original Newton.Then we can explain the three laws of Kepler.So that's the substance of his theory.Where's his "no flaws"?He explained all the observed and experimental phenomena known at the time.Of course, there are no flaws at all.“Unusual” is reflected in the scientific theory that is the first quantitative and systematic in human history.He had rightly predicted the existence of Neptune, and the correct prophecy had been observed after he had predicted it.It was Neptune's discovery that established the soundness of Newton's mechanical theory as the first natural scientific theory.So from that point of view, Newton's mechanics theory was beautiful, undeficient and unusual.But someone doesn't think so. That's Einstein.Einstein believes that Newton's gravitational theory is flawed and reflected in two ways.One is that theory is flawed.Einstein argues that the instantaneous effect in Newton's theory is contrary to the narrow theory of relativity.So he asked what gravity really is?Deficiencies in usefulness.Einstein has taken a deep look at the anomaly of recent developments in Mercury.He believes that this cannot be explained by Newton's gravitational theory.So he asked what the scope of application of the Newton Gravitation theory was.It's two very big flaws for Einstein.Einstein therefore proposed a broad relativity which, of course, filled the gap in the Newton theory.His theoretical absence was reflected in the essence of gravity, which was the bending of time and space caused by quality.The bending of time and space determines the movement of all matter, including the movement of light.The absence of practicality is reflected in its approximation of the Newtonian theory under the weak gravitational field, which is more precise than the Newtonian theory in the case of the strong gravitational field.All the phenomena that the Newtonian theory can interpret are thus explained in general relativity.Broad relativity is also fully applicable where the Newtonian doctrine cannot be interpreted or where error cannot be ignored.The general theory of relativity was therefore not flawed at that time.So the theory also needs to be less common in order to satisfy the broad rule of aesthetics that are not common without defects.Another example of no flaw is that I've just told you about its theory, which is the essence of gravity. Practically, it's about making up for Newton's inaccuracies.The most important thing is that Mercury's aberrations in recent days.That's something Newton's theory doesn't understand at all.In general relativity, I gave you a list of places where we can see that this result is accurately calculated in broad relativity.A major flaw in Newton's theory has thus been addressed.Broad relativism is also commonplace and reflects the first theory to establish a profound link between material and space.I have just spoken of the Newton theory, which was the first quantitative and systematic scientific theory at the time, whereas the general relativity theory was the first to establish a profound link between material and space, and the first to reveal that the time and space of the material world are inherently bending.It used to be straight, and now it's crooked.And this theory has succeeded in predicting new types of celestial bodies and a series of new phenomena, including black holes, the expansion of the universe, gravitational distortions, gravitational red shifts, gravitational waves, and so on.Most of this is confirmed by observation.There are only a few left that are still waiting to be confirmed.Let me give you a brief example.This is the prophecy of gravitational contrasts to the test of general relativity.Because general relativity predicts that the light of distant objects must be skewed by the light of the Sun's gravitational field when passing near the Sun.So this one was observed by the experiment.It was this observation that established once and for all the superiority of the theory of general relativity over the Newton theory, which at that time led to widespread acceptance of the theory of general relativity.Are there any shortcomings in the theory of general relativity today?If I say it's the most beautiful scientific theory, we certainly need to discuss whether it's flawed or not.In practical terms, you can say it's hard to understand the theory.Of course it's not Einstein's fault, is it?It's hard to understand that you didn't learn.Is there a flaw in theory?We know that there are problems and inconsistencies in quantum theory.Well, we'll certainly expect Professor Pan to solve this problem in the future. Okay.But at this point we do not know whether quantum theory is wrong or relativity in general.The question of the singularity was that Einstein did not believe the black hole that his own theory predicted, but he thought that nature might be able to avoid the singularity.Of course, quantum physicists think that quantum theory may be able to bypass the question of the singular.But none of these efforts have been successful today.I've done my own research on the question of singularities.The results of my research, if he lets me go forward, I will tell you that my research shows that there are actually no peculiarities within the black hole.But there is no need for new natural patterns.There is only a need to understand and apply the general relativity.It was a few years ago that I crossed back to report this to Mr. Einstein.There are no flaws!So Einstein's theory, as we see it today, is still the least common without flaws.We are also looking forward to more unusual general relativism predictions.Like gravitational waves.Well, now the scientific community is rumouring, and maybe it's true, that the gravitational waves have been detected.If that is the case, it must be a Nobel Prize.Of course, we expect that the unusualness of this broader relative prophecy will bring us many, uh, surprises.Finally, what are the dynamics of social development and the essence of science, technology and innovation?Let's use this aesthetic theory to explain it.There's no universal beauty, there's no universal beauty.As I said earlier, beauty is the only way to live.Not the most beautiful is the more beautiful.The quest for beauty is therefore the driving force of social development.We all know that technological innovation is about filling the gaps, while scientific innovation is about finding out that it is not common.So my conclusion is that the dynamics of social development and the essence of song technology and innovation are the pursuit of beauty.That's my report.Thank you!</seg>
<seg id=21>Hello!Uh, I'm going to introduce you to OLAP practice today.It's a 100-degree product of PALO.And, uh, the subject of the catalogue that I'm introducing today will be divided into four main areas.One is going to introduce us to the background of our OLAP 100 degrees.There is also an analysis of the scenes that we are applying, as well as of several cases, so that you can make some reference when you use them.Then there is a brief introduction to our collective structure and to some key features.Well, first of all, let me introduce you to PALO.Well, the reason why PALO's name is written upside down in OLAP is to form PALO.Then PALO is an interactive MPP-based database that supports SQL search and SQL search.And then it looks at a 100 TB to PB T level, then it's basically structured data, and then we support a millisecond-to-second response.And then it's developed by the 100-degree data department, and, uh, it's also used extensively within the 100-degrees.Then more than a thousand machines would have been deployed internally, and perhaps the largest operation would have been above 100 TB levels.OK, so first of all, we'll all probably hear more about OLTP.What's OLAP anyway?OLAP uh by name is called online number and analysis of a concept like a uh, uh, engine.And then here's a table that makes a distinction between OLTP and OLAP.You can, uh, look at it in detail.Then, first of all, from an application-oriented perspective, OLTP is mainly dealing with some routine transactions, and then OLAP is looking at some queries, analysis of decision-making, and a slightly larger number of data.And then the mode of access, and then O OLTP could be some batches of small queries, and then some OLAPs, some composite polymers, drills, drills.Then, from the point of view of the amount of data, OLTP is generally a relatively small amount of data, and it is also, uh, a typical access to the latest data, but the amount of data that OLTP OLAP may visit is larger.It then has multiple versions, because it has some historical data that need to be traced back and historical trends that need to be analysed.Then, in terms of data updating and the organization of the data, OLTP is generally a real-time update.And then, uh, it has some sort of organized form of data, mainly some of the paradigms in some database areas.And then OLAP's probably, uh, mostly batch updates.And then it's, uh, article-by-article update with very little demand.And then some of its, uh, forms of data organization are mainly some of the models that include information, some of the famous analyses in the context of the scene.Uh, the difference between Online and Offline is mostly about a response time.Online may be more focused on responding quickly and in a timely manner, giving results first.And then when Offline, for example, often uses some of Hadop's analytical tools, maybe it doesn't put that much emphasis on the time of the uh response.Now let's look at some of the industry's commonly used OLAP systems.There's something about, uh, a long time ago the OLAP system was just monopolized by some commercial companies.Then, in recent years, with the development of big data technology, especially in the Hadop community, some open-source products have emerged.And then there's some uh, we're on the cloud.For example, there are some OLAP products on the clouds in Google and Amazon.Well, PALO is a OLAP product.And then it's based on some of its positioning, and here's some comparison, some of the positioning of PALO when we were designing it.First, PALO is a low product, and then it can expand linearly.Uh, support cloud deployment.In fact, we PALO are actually actually online on the 100-degree open cloud, and if you're even some outside users, you can try it if you want to.Well, there's the PALO that supports high utility, and then it's high performance, and it's designed to be at 100,000 QPS.And one hundred Gs per second of scan should be the whole cluster and that level of magnitude.And then we can import at the highest possible speed to an entire cluster of, uh, ten terabytes per hour.OK, uh, after the background of PALO, let's talk about some of the U.S. scenes of PALO's, some of our cases within 100 degrees, some of our internal product lines, some of our typical cases, and you can look at them.If you want to see if you have something like that, you can think about our PALO if you need it.Well, it's basically some statistical analysis of the data.And then, in detail, there might be two major larger scenarios.One is the statement, and the other is our multidimensional analysis.Well, what was our product line like before we had a PALO?For a statement, it may be, for example, to take an uh timed task and then run on time every day, and end up with the final result and then import it into MySQL.Why is this the end result?Because MySQL is problematic when dealing with large amounts of data, there are a number of lax performance considerations that do not meet the requirements, and then it can only guide the final results.And then there are some things that, uh, might end up getting results like this, and then, uh, go to the user and look for them, and then end up emailing them, or some other way to show them.Yeah, but that's a problem.It's good that you're on time duty, and if you're going to, uh, or if you're going to lead the final results to MySQL, you're going to have a lot of jobs and lots of tables in MySQL, which are very expensive to maintain.And, uh, it's probably a lot of time that faith and efficiency don't meet the requirements.This user will just do it.And then the multidimensional analysis might be some of what we used to say about Hadop+Hive.Uh, but if you're thinking about the statute of limitations, maybe you could come and think about our PALO.Here's some examples of some of the 100-degree product lines using our PALO.First of all, it's 100 degrees, and it's using our PALO in the presentation, uh.This, uh, it's first and foremost what it's 100 degrees.You should all probably know better.Ah, it's a professional analytical tool for a professional website that we provide 100 times.So, uh, what's it look like to use one of our scenes for, uh, a piece of it?Imported every five minutes, followed by more than 300 watches.The maximum amount of data on a single day is probably more than one TB, and then the maximum QPS per second is 2,000.And then before we moved from uh, other systems to PALO before we used PALO, there were over 220 machines before us to over 50 of them.And then, uh, the average response time is 30 milliseconds from the 60 milliseconds before us to the 30 milliseconds after we move the PALO most.And this page is actually a screenshot of PALO's, uh, a 100-degree report of one of their interfaces.Well, what it means is that every day on the left side, it's got some PVs, some traffic analyses, some indicator dimensions.And then you just switch and then every day you're going to, uh, produce these statements on a regular basis.Next, one of our applications in the field of multidimensional analysis, is a 100-degree takeout.100 degrees of takeout and, uh, it has a data platform inside it, using an engine from our PALO.And then it's, uh, running schoolmates going to analyze orders, merchants, sales people, and stuff like that.And then it's characteristic that my dimensions are custom-made.That's what I am. Well, it's a typical scenario of a multi-dimensional analysis.And then you customize, uh, the dimensions of you to uh it, and you specify the dimensions, and then you can produce the results of this analysis in real time and on time.It's very helpful to make decisions about what's going on in their, uh, upper class.Well, then the next one is an uh, thumpy, an internal data set of our thumps, and the bottom is useful for our PALO engine.There's more in it, there's more in it, there's more in it, there's more in it, there's more in it, there's more in it, there's more in it, there's more in it, there's more in it, there's more in it, there's more in it, there's more in it, there's more in it, there's more in it, there's more in it, there's more in it, there's more in it, there's more in it, there's more in it, there's more in it, there's more in it, there's more in it.And then it turns us on before us, uh, from the minute level before us to the second level.Here's some of the scenes that we've introduced to PALO, and some of the typical examples that we've used.And what's down there, uh, if there's anyone in the class who needs it in the future, might consider if we could use our PALO.Well, here's a brief description of some of the PALO's architecture and some of the key technical features.So you can use us, and you can think about, uh, having some knowledge of us first, and making better use of us.Well, first of all, the general structure of PALO, and for the upper-level users, we just need it to have experience with MySQL before we can simply use us, because we support MySQL's agreement.So we split the insides of PALO into FE and BE two, uh, two layers.And it's responsible for the metadata, for the analysis, for the analysis, and for the planning of these tasks.And the bee is responsible for the distribution of data, our multiple copies, the execution of our specific queries, and, uh, some specific scans of the data, which are done in the ben.What we're talking about here is that we have multiple FEs, and that's what we're thinking, first of all, that we support the high availability of metadata.Any f between any more FEs.Uh, we have a kind of RAFT agreement to achieve a high availability of metadata.And the other thing is that when we're stressed, we've got a bottleneck in our performance, and we're able to grow horizontally linearly through a linear extension of the FE to raise our uh FE's this uh high-utility.This is just a brief introduction to our structure.If we have detailed technical details, we'll have a chance to communicate more in detail later.And then, uh, then we're going to be brief about some of the characteristics of our PALO technology.Ah, for users, we just need MySQL experience to use us, because we support MySQL.Because supporting MySQL has a number of advantages.The first is that the learning curve is very low for users.And then we can be easily compatible with top-level applications, e.g. with JDBC in the user program, with OR ODBC to visit us, and we can be easily compatible.To switch is to switch the cost of a user-to-user switch to a very low cost of switching from the original system to PALO.And then it's possible that we're now easy to access some of the very, very common BI tools in the city's uh market, and then, like Tableau, Saiku, like Qlik, can be very, very easy to connect.And then some of MySQL-related peripherals, we can all, uh, use them directly.For the use of PALO, it is easy for a person with experience of using MySQL to use PALO after some uh support of MySQL.The first line, you use MySQL to specify an uh machine port, and then the user, the password, can be connected to our PALO.Of course the user is connected to MySQL on the client's side, but the backstage is our PALO, and the user doesn't think we're a poor MySQL server.And then build the vault, uh, the statements are basically the same as MySQL.Ah, and down there is a Load and, uh, our Load imported some of the imports of Show Load's uh, these queries.And down at the bottom, there's a select uh SQL query, and, uh, these are basically the same as MySQL's.Parallel databases, a large-scale database of OLAP non-uh-OLAP, we might first stress our high availability.Uh, the first one might have mentioned a little bit before, that our metadata were between the FE and, uh, high-availability, kept by an agreement of the type RAFT, ah.And what about the data? How do we make it work?The first is to say that we have a lot of copies, and then we still have the ability to automatically supplement and automatically balance between copies.Here's a little bit of this metadata from our FE, uh, one of the metadata from the FE.We will not go into detail about this.Well, then, uh, we're going to introduce a very typical model of data in a PALO, which you have to be aware of when you use PALO.Well, if we have a table like this, we have a list of Time, ID, country, then click and consume.And then I'm in the PALO making a distinction between the Key and the Value columns.The first three rows are a Key column, and the last two are a Value column.And, uh, first of all, PA's bottom storage in all Key's PALO is in order, and this orderly benefit is that I'm able to physically and physically locate, and this dichotomy should be understood by all.And then all Key's in PALO's internal storage is the only one.If the Key column is the same as the Value column automatically aggregates the data imported in that multiple batches.Key and Value columns, each Value column can mean, uh, that each Value column can specify a form of aggregation, and the same Value columns in Key columns automatically aggregate.Well, then, uh, here's an example, for example, of a day-to-day data, where you import a batch every five minutes, and maybe more than two hundred and eighty times that day.If it doesn't come together automatically, there's at least the same thing that Key has to produce at least two hundred and eighty data.And when you analyze it, you're going to have to bring these two hundred and eighty pieces together in real time.But inside the PALO, we'll have you two hundred and eighty in one piece by the time you import, so the speed at which you search the search will be very efficient.A more detailed scenario, assuming that we have a Base table, is our basic data table, with three data in it.And then we import another batch of data, and we import such a batch, we call Delta.And then here's the incremental data.It's the same as the previous Key will merge and the different Keys will add.And then that leads to the creation of this result, which would contain four pieces of data.What about the former Value column, because it's a way of uniting in a way that, uh, is a way of uniting.Then it'll automatically merge.And there's another thing about PA-PALO in the internal storage engine, which is that we support the objectification view.For example, a table like the one on the left is our basic data, our raw data.And then when you import PALO, we generate a base table.And then, as we said earlier, PALO's sorted by Key column, so the order changes a little.But if one assumes that we need such a scenario, that is, the user, that his queries contain only the ID column here and its PV column, and that there is no concern for the time column and the non-provincial column, then at that point we can build a homogenous view and then reduce the columns.That would result, for example, in the creation of such a matrix, with only IDs and PVs in it.When the user comes to the query, if he does not need to use the time column and the province column, we can respond directly with this matrix, so the speed will increase.Of course, it has a weakness.And that's what you're doing when you generate this objectification view, and it takes a small fraction of that data space.It's just that we're having a little bit of a trade-off in the production environment.Well, one more thing, cough, is that this objectification view, which is automatically updated when you import, and then automatically locates automatically when you search, uh, so that the user does not need any extra intervention.Here's a few other important features of PALO's physical storage.First of all, we support the list, and, of course, we support the list, and at the same time we support the list.What's the advantage of that?The first, uh, when you ask, is when you have only a part of the column and not all of the columns, because it's stored separately for each column, so that the amount of data that needs to be cleaned is small.And the other is that when you put each column of data together, then this column of data is in the same format, so that when we go to storage, we compress it and reduce the amount of data that is stored to a storage space.Ah, PALO's in support of the two-storey division.And then what about the division?This is for a large processing system, and it's bound to spread the data over a number of machines.So what's a two-storey partition?What do we, uh, have in comparison to the traditional layer of partitions?First of all, our uh PALO's two-storey partition can, uh, easily isolate old and new data.For example, a new, uh, new division is me, for example, in the first sector, where we separate the data from the data through the dimension of time, so that the new data will be imported into the new, new, first-level division, and then the old data will be left in the older, older sector.And that's how it actually reduces a lot of historical data, and that's what we do when we go to the bottom of the backstage to store the engine.And there's a way to simplify the size of the table.How do you say that?Let's say we're in one layer of partition, and we're holding an uh, commonly used Hash partition, so when you keep increasing the amount of data, and you can't deal with it, you want to reduce the amount of data in each barrel, and you just have to increase the number of partitions.But for a Hash bucket, if you need to add, uh, you need to respirator, it's a very high price, because you need to recalculate all the data.But there's no, uh, there's no need for a two-tier division, and when my data is constantly increasing, I just have to adjust this Hash bucket number on the basis of the two-storey partition in the interior when I'm building a new, uh, level-one partition.Here's an example of an uh, SQL statement that we're in an uh, uh, two-storey partition.First of all, you look at the dimension of time, and it's a first-tier partition, and then it's a Hash bucket, and it's got 32 barrels.One example of a two-tiered division, one example of a grammar.Then PALO supports the concept of hierarchical storage.So what's the concept of graded storage?So, for example, our servers are both SSD and mechanical hard drives.So one S, on the one hand, we really want to use SSD's high performance, and, on the other hand, because SSD's smaller and smaller, we have to use the mechanical hard drive.But on the other hand, from the point of view of our inquiries, when data can generally be divided into new data and older data, the probability of new data being searched is much higher than older data.So we can put new data on SSD, and then old data on machine hard drives.But it's very costly if our manual needs to actually store that data to move it.So PALO supports automatic migration and movement of these data, between SSD and mechanical hard drives.Now, let's talk about how some of the PA PALO's performance is going to be high and some of the features.First of all, what we've already mentioned, uh, is that PALO is an executing engine for MPP.What's a MPP?It's an acronym for large-scale parallel processing.This is actually one of the cores of PALO's high performance.And on the other hand, we're PALOs for quantitative implementation.Uh, it's a quantitative implementation that is actually a very low-level, uh, optimisation.It reduces some, uh, of some, uh, CPU-based, waterlines. It's more friendly, and then branch forecasts are better.And then there's one that says, "Well, we're uh for one because we're distributed, and then we're um, PALO, and we support a very common Merge-Sort.And that's when we sort a big big amount of data in order of order, we sort it together between multiple nodes.And then it's better for the uh-to-the-o-o-o-o than for the uh-o-o-o-o-o.And then there's the idea of sorting out a couple of large-scale aggregates, and then if you have a huge amount of data, there's no way that memory can work, and at that point we're supporting the data.And then, um, when our execution and storage were very good.One of the problems that we often encounter is that when more than one user uses the same cluster, one user interacts with another.Also, for the same user, its different queries, or rather its imports, are interactive between imports and queries, and between queries and queries.Why?Because this uh resource for the uh system is limited.When he sent a very large query, it was possible that other inquiries would be affected.Well, at this point in time, we, PALO, are offering a whole, uh, resource-segregated package of solutions to this problem.Well, let's just say we're in favour of setting a certain priority for the operation, and then, like High, Low, Normal.And then make sure that between these different queries, it doesn't say that because you have a very big gap, you take away all the resources from the other queries, and then this little one cannot be carried out.Well, of course we're on the inside to achieve the Group.A detailed option for the physical isolation of our resources, the latest version of which we continue to optimize, and then, uh, now we're on the cloud and then we're going to be better off with the next version of the resource segregation that we're going to have to come up with.Okay, let's not go into detail here.Here's one of our simple, uh, introductions.Uh, and then for the uh, uh, uh, the import and export function of PALO.Because, uh, we're supporting a variety of ways of importing, like your data, whatever it is, like, on Hadop, you're on the local, you're on the bos.Ah, we can all support the import of our PALO system.And then there was, uh, a scene where the user, he also supported the import of a multi-watched atom that went into effect.So when you import your atoms into multiple tables, this is what users do at times in business, and that's what we can guarantee.And then we export that we're similar to imports.We also support one of the data destinations, like multiple data sources, one of the ones that supports Hadop, the Bos, and the storage of these uh storages.And then we'll introduce it, which means that PALO is an O.OLAP is a sort of scene that's out of the way, a report and an analysis.So, in response to some of the scenes you've been analyzing, we've provided some of the SQLs, some of the strong support, just some of the upswings.First of all, we support what is worth mentioning is that our PALOs support window functions, and this one, with analytical experience, probably feels like you've got a window function, that you're very high in terms of calculation, ranking, ring comparison, or that the owners have become very simple, uh, and efficient.Then, for example, three of the top paid people in the same sector, which is difficult to do without window functions.Let's try it.And, uh, we're just trying to improve the user's ease of use.Ah, we're on a customer basis at MySQL, and you can easily do, for example, when we call and see our help files, you don't have to say it. You just have to connect to our service, you can connect to our service with MySQL, and you can easily access help and help with information.You, uh, Help is grammar, like MySQL, Herp whatever.For example, if you want to see the import, Help Load can.Well, that would reduce the number of users who, uh, help with different files, help the pages switch between them, and it would be very user-friendly to use them when you use them.Uh, PALO's, uh, uh, something, basically, it's just here.Well, what's down here is that we, uh, are now open to some of our contacts.First of all, this 100-degree open cloud is the PALO, which has access to the 100-degree open cloud, and then this link allows you to understand some of our products and functions in detail by going to the cloud.And if there's a problem, you can send us an e-mail.All right, thank you!</seg>
